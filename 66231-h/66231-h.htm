<br />DOUBLY WARNED.</h2>
<p>A small apartment, walled with rough logs, and blackened
by smoke.</p>
<p>A substantial fire burns in an uncouth but serviceable fireplace,
and a man reclines on the puncheons in the ruddy
blaze.</p>
<p>His sole companion is a huge yellow dog of the mastiff
species; and his master&rsquo;s long black locks rest upon his shaggy
coat.</p>
<p>It is nine o&rsquo;clock at night, and the moon shines in an unclouded
firmament.</p>
<p>Not a sound disturbs the stillness of the wood; but just
at the edge of the meager clearing that lies before the cabin,
a little river flows northward with a low noise, for it is almost
bank full.</p>
<p>Man and dog are wide awake; the former gazes into the
fire, the latter looks up into the hard, sunbrowned face.</p>
<p>The master is a great, strong man, whose looks, physique
and voice, when he speaks, indicates a long frontier life. He
is perhaps three and forty years of age. Some would say that
he is fifty; but people must not judge age by certain crows-feet
on the brow; troubles make young men old. His occupation
is revealed by a quantity of animal traps lying in one
corner of the room, and suspended from a rafter overhead
hangs a bundle of skins, ready for the market at Fort Sandusky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>But he rises and looks at the dog, who bristles up and runs
to the door, protected by a strong oaken plank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Yellow Dick?&rdquo; asks the trapper, standing beside
his companion, rifle in hand, and peering into the moonlight
through a crevice between two logs. &ldquo;I would hev
sworn that I heard the voice of a man; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused abruptly, for Yellow Dick had suddenly pricked
his long ears anew, and the trapper began to unbarricade the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis old Johnny, Dick, as sure as death,&rdquo; he said, glancing
at the mastiff while he worked at his plank. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t
been this way for a three month. Mebbe he brings news
from the seat of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog seemed to understand the man, for his fierceness
abated, and he stepped from the portal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I knew it was Johnny Appleseed,&rdquo; the trapper
said triumphantly, as he opened the cabin door, and let a
flood of moonlight into the dingy room. &ldquo;Here he comes,
down the river. What&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s saying, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker leaned forward and caught these words uttered
in a melodious voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit of the Lord is upon me, and he hath anointed
me to blow the trumpet in the wilderness and sound the
alarm in the forest: for behold the tribes of the heathen are
round about your door, and a devouring flame followeth after
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The herald of danger stood near the edge of the water, and
looked like some wild being from spirit-land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Johnny means somethin&rsquo;; somethin&rsquo;s gone wrong
somewhar,&rdquo; cried the trapper, becoming excited, and then in
a louder tone he spoke the singular cognomen of the man of
the wilderness&mdash;&ldquo;Johnny Appleseed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter turned and after some hesitation came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not detain the Lord&rsquo;s anointed long,&rdquo; said the little
wiry man, exhibiting his old restless activity, &ldquo;for the Philistines
are this night sweeping down upon the scattered tents
of Israel, who will be found without the cities of refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny, what has happened?&rdquo; queried the settler,
who could not repress a smile at the herald&rsquo;s quaint phraseology.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Philistines hold revel in the great walled city on the
northern water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! has Hull surrendered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, Israel is again in captivity, and the families on
her borders must feel the fire now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper was silent for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the red-coated and red-skinned devils are coming to
devastate the frontiers,&rdquo; he said, in a tone scarcely audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their forces no man can number,&rdquo; said the strange herald.
&ldquo;They are like the sands of the sea-shore. But I must go.
I am appointed to deliver my message before every door in
the forest, that the Lord&rsquo;s chosen may flee from the wrath to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go, Johnny. I should not have detained you a minute.
Yours is an errand of mercy. I have a duty to perform
this night. Go, Johnny; tell them all of the swoop of the
red eagles; and tell them that Wolf Cap says, &lsquo;Fly to the block-houses
without delay!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pioneer hero started forward, but paused after taking
a step, and drew the portion of an old volume from his
bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here news right fresh from heaven,&rdquo; he said, and he tore
a leaf from the book and handed it to the trapper.</p>
<p>It was a leaf from Swedenborg&rsquo;s writings, for Johnny
Appleseed&mdash;Jonathan Chapman&mdash;is no myth, and he was a
true disciple of the Swedish seer.</p>
<p>Having accomplished his duty, the strange man, clad in
nothing save a garment fashioned from a coffee sack, and
bearing a long distaff, started off to spread dismay throughout
the fire-lands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Hull has surrendered,&rdquo; muttered Wolf-Cap through
clenched lips, as he turned into the cabin again. &ldquo;I know it
was a cowardly affair, for Detroit was proof against ten thousand
foes; but Hull was the wrong man in the right place. I
know it; I told the soldiers so when I war there not long
ago. These frontiers hev got to be desolated now, through
the cowardice of one man,&rdquo; the lone trapper continued, busying
himself with preparations for a night journey. &ldquo;Our
block-houses are poor excuses for bulwarks; but we must get
the women and children in them as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>He donned his hunting accouterments and the wolf-skin
cap which had given him the <i>sobriquet</i> that entitles our romance,
and replenished the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you to keep house, Dick,&rdquo; he said, addressing
the dog. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back about daybreak. Now old fellow do
your duty, and don&rsquo;t let a sneakin&rsquo; red-skin over this portal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He patted the dog&rsquo;s shaggy back, barricaded the door, and
made his exit from the cabin, by the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure that Johnny missed &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said, pausing
for a moment beside the cabin and communing with himself.
&ldquo;He came down the river, and they are too far to his left.
Yes, I guess he missed &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last word still quivered his lips when he started in a
north-easterly direction, leaving the river to his left.</p>
<p>A well-defined trail stretched before him, and he walked
rapidly through the moonlit forest, trailing his long-barreled
rifle at his side.</p>
<p>It was a night in August, 1812, and, as not a breath of
wind was stirring, the heat was oppressive. Once or twice
the hunter started a deer from the weed-fringed margin of
some forest stream, or frightened a coyote from his feast of
freshly-slain bird.</p>
<p>Suddenly he paused and listened to a silver voice, soaring
skyward far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Huldah&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; he said, audibly. &ldquo;No woman
can sing like her in these parts. I don&rsquo;t know, but some how
or other I think an uncommon sight of that girl. She looks
so much like Bessie did twenty years ago,&rdquo; and here the rough
deer-skin sleeve dashed a tear from the speaker&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wonder what makes her so happy just now&mdash;when
terror sits in many a white girl&rsquo;s heart. Ah! old Johnny did
not warn <i>them</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped the little rivulet by which he stood while speaking,
and threaded the forest mazes again. Presently he came
upon a neat clearing, in the center of which, surrounded by
a rail-fence, stood a cabin, somewhat larger than his bachelor
abode. An air of industry pervaded the spot, and the honeysuckles
that half concealed the little square windows, proclaimed
the presence of the softer&mdash;the flower-loving sex.</p>
<p>The song that had startled the trapper by the little creek,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
was mute now, and a dead silence brooded over the settler&rsquo;s
home, on which the moonlight softly fell.</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap leaned against a tree at the edge of the clearing,
and thought of the coming whirlwind of destruction.</p>
<p>He thought till he gritted his teeth, and started forward,
impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the toil of months,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Levi has labored
like a giant to build a shelter for Huldah&rsquo;s head, and now to
think that the flames must, in one brief hour, destroy it all.
Oh, I wish I could wield the thunderbolts of heaven for a
single minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He approached the cabin boldly, his giant form bathed in
moonshine, and a low growl saluted his ears as he stepped
upon the little porch before the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; said a woman&rsquo;s voice, beyond the heavy
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me&mdash;Wolf-Cap,&rdquo; answered the trapper, and he heard nimble
fingers undoing the fastenings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, neighbor Belt,&rdquo; said a voice as the door flew
open, and a beautiful young girl, whose right hand griped a
rifle, appeared to the hunter.</p>
<p>He obeyed, and as he crossed the threshold the door was
closed again and barred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye warn&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; for me to-night, I guess,&rdquo; he said,
taking in the room at a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, neighbor Belt; but you are none the less welcome.
Father has just retired&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be thar in a minute, Belt,&rdquo; interrupted a man&rsquo;s voice
in the next room. &ldquo;I thought it war you when I heard your
step on the porch. What&rsquo;s up? Ye kin talk while I
dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good deal what&rsquo;s bad is up,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap, in a loud
one. &ldquo;Hull has surrendered, and a swarm of British and
Indians are pouring down upon the frontier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you, Belt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker had appeared like a flash, and, scarcely more
than half-dressed, stood before the trapper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told me?&mdash;Johnny Appleseed. He went down the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
last, Armstrong. We&rsquo;ve enjoyed comparative quiet thus far
during the war; but the cowardice&mdash;I know it was just that
and nothin&rsquo; else&mdash;of Hull, has unloosed the dogs of hell, an&rsquo;
they&rsquo;ll be here pretty soon. To the block-house is the cry
now. If safety lies anywhere, it is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Levi Armstrong, the old settler, stood in the dim light of
the tin fat lamp, and quivered with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belt,&rdquo; he said, slowly and with emphasis, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo;
to give up the work of my hands without a struggle. You
kin bet on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Huldah must go to the block-house. Strong&rsquo;s is the
strongest, and best defended. We must act&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as father remains from the block-house I remain,
too,&rdquo; interrupted Huldah Armstrong, as she touched Wolf-Cap&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;I share his love for our home. He shall not
be separated from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huldah, you must go to Strong&rsquo;s to-morrow,&rdquo; said Levi.
&ldquo;I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am content to go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When do you look
for the marauders, neighbor Belt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are liable to come at any hour,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;But in truth <i>I</i> do not look for them for several days yet.
No doubt Johnny heard of the disaster from some Indian, and
is many hours in advance of the slayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you going to do, Belt?&rdquo; asked Levi Armstrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had settled upon no plan of action. I&rsquo;ve got a cabin,
and I hate to leave it to the torch. The Night-Hawks are
with Proctor, you know. I wonder if they will come down
upon the frontiers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure they will, neighbor Belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help the frontiers, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must go back,&rdquo; said the trapper; &ldquo;nobody is at
home but Yellow Dick. I guess we&rsquo;ll not go to the block-house
till to-morrow night. I think we&rsquo;re safe in keeping
aloof till then; &rsquo;tis best, you know, to seem in ignorance of
the threatening danger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too, Belt. You&rsquo;ll come over to-morrow evening,
ready for the run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here, and then&rdquo;&mdash;with a glance at Levi that
told much&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll shelter our heads beneath Strong&rsquo;s
roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several minutes later Wolf-Cap was returning to his cabin,
and at length the grayish dawn of day revealed it to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody has disturbed Dick,&rdquo; he said, after inspecting the
little structure&rsquo;s surroundings. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good housekeeper&mdash;no
woman in this land kin beat him, but&mdash; What&rsquo;s that?
By Huron! somebody hes nailed a piece of paper to my
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper was walking forward while speaking, and it
was a piece of paper on his cabin door that called the exclamation
to his lips. With his eyes fastened upon the object,
he quickened his steps, and presently paused on the flagstone
stoop.</p>
<p>Before his eyes was a piece of dingy paper, bordered with
blood, and held in its place by a knife, the point of which was
buried deeply in the firm wood!</p>
<p>The uncouth letters had been traced on the dirty sheet with
a stick dipped in gore, and were arranged in the following
order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">We hunt you. You know us. Fly or die!</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">The Night-Hawks.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trapper looked at the warning a long time, and gradually
a smile of contempt wreathed his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Royal Funk, you and your devils are in these parts
again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I tell you, once for all, that I am not
an illegal squatter. You can&rsquo;t scare Card Belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, without more words, he ascended to the roof and
joined Yellow Dick, who received him with manifestations
of delight in the room below. Fearlessly he threw wide the
cabin door, and spread a map of the North-west, face downward,
on the floor.</p>
<p>Then, with a piece of charcoal, he traced these words on
the parchment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Roy Funk, I&rsquo;m going to remain on the fire-lands. You can&rsquo;t</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
<i>frighten me. I spare not and no mercy ask. No block-house
shall shelter me!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice the trapper read the defiance to his dog, as though
the animal was possessed of comprehension, and then he pinned
it to the door with the point of a knife.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />SILVER HAND, THE WYANDOT.</h2>
<p>The reader has heard Wolf-Cap aver that he was not an
illegal squatter on the fire-lands, and while he prepares to sustain
the defiance nailed to his cabin door, let us inquire into
the meaning of his declaration, and thereby, if possible, add
to the interest of our story.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;fire-lands&rdquo; were not, as the casual reader would suppose,
a tract of country blackened and rendered barren almost
by the flames. On the contrary, their broad acres, well watered
by majestic rivers, teemed with plenty, and even their
<i>indolent</i> farmer to-day finds no starvelings about his premises.</p>
<p>Erie, Huron, and a small part of Ottawa counties, comprise
that portion of the Western Ohio Reserve known as the fire-lands.
The tract embraces five hundred thousand acres, and
the term &ldquo;fire-lands&rdquo; originated from the circumstance of the
State of Connecticut having granted these lands, in 1792, as a
donation, to certain sufferers by fire occasioned by the English
during the Revolutionary war, particularly at New London,
Fairfield and Norwalk. Connecticut, at that time, holding
jurisdiction over much land in Ohio, made other grants,
of a nature similar to the above, and to this day the Western
Reserve is often called by its old title&mdash;New Connecticut.</p>
<p>Though Wolf-Cap, or Card Belt, was not a sufferer at English
hands, he had a right to the ground on which his little
cabin stood. That right was a grant from the proprietors of
the fire-lands; but he had had the misfortune to lose the document
while <i>en route</i> to his claim. He had trapped along
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the streams of his native State, Connecticut, until they refused
to yield the wished-for supply of fur-bearing animals, and,
longing for a new pelt El Dorado, he fell in with the inducements
offered by the settlements of New Connecticut.</p>
<p>He established his claim to a certain spot of ground, notwithstanding
the loss of the title, and erected his cabin, in
1811. A treaty had previously been made with the Wyandots,
who inhabited a portion of the ground, and until the
breaking out of the war of 1812, the red denizens of the fire-lands
had kept the promises of the treaty unbroken.</p>
<p>But in the settlement of the fire-lands, as in the settlement
of all new countries, a class of rough characters appeared on
the surface. These were, in the greater part, Canadian trappers,
who were dwelling on the grant prior to its change of
owners, and they refused to accede to the demands of the
legal squatters. They had no right to the land, for they had
been English soldiers, and disturbers of the peace between
whites and Indians.</p>
<p>They drove honest squatters from their homes, and carried
on a reign of terror throughout the fire-lands, until the Connecticut
company overawed them with settlers. Still they
carried on their lawlessness. At midnight they would break
into some squatter&rsquo;s cabin and demand a sight of his deed;
and if the poor man could not produce it, as was often the
case, considering the poor facilities extant those days for preserving
paper documents, he would be hustled from his door,
and the torch applied to the logs.</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap&rsquo;s domicil was invaded one night, two months
prior to the opening of hostilities; but he gave the Night-Hawks&mdash;as
the outlaws were called&mdash;such a warm reception,
that they were glad to depart without accomplishing their
purpose. In the affray one of the scoundrels was fatally shot
by the trapper, and their numbers thus reduced to nine.</p>
<p>The leader of the band was a rather handsome, brigandisa
sort of man, boasting of the name of Royal Funk. He had
served under Arnold in his descent upon Connecticut, and followed
other Tories to the West after the patriot struggle. He
had a commanding eye, and a nature fitted to lord it over a
lot of low characters like those whom he drew around him
in New Connecticut, and christened the Night-Hawks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Their villainies were brought to a close by the declaration of
war. One day they left the fire-lands, and joined the British
army of the North-west, and the settlers breathed freer. They
devoutly wished that every Night-Hawk might fall beneath
American bullets, and for months the tract enjoyed a peace
that seemed a foretaste of the one quiet peace called blessed!</p>
<p>British gold drew hundreds of savages to the flag of St.
George; but a portion of the Wyandots adhered heroically to
the American cause. The fire-land settlers centered all their
hopes on Hull. If he would repulse the allies before Detroit,
their homes were safe. If the General failed, then the Night-Hawks
and their red helpers would return to devastate homes
illy defended.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reader can imagine the terror spread throughout
the grant by the wild message of Johnny Appleseed:
&ldquo;The tribes of the heathen are round about your doors, and
a devouring flame followeth after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to help Proctor. When we return, look
out, usurper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such words Wolf-Cap found chalked on his cabin door, on
his return from Sandusky, one day in the spring lately passed.
He saw that he had saved his life by being absent, and he
awaited with impatience and anxiety the result of British
operations in the North-west. Noble-minded and courageous,
almost to a fault, he did not fear the threats of the Night-Hawks,
as the reader has seen by his defiance; but the unprotected
settlers called forth his sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help take Huldah to Strong&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said, looking at his
dog, after posting his defiance, &ldquo;and then I&rsquo;ll make this cabin
our castle, Dick. I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;ve got much to live for,
since Bessie left me, and I&rsquo;ll try to rid the people of several
of their plagues afore I go. Here be six rifles an&rsquo; plenty
o&rsquo; ammunition, and we&rsquo;ll drop a doe to-night, if it gets
cloudy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper hailed the approach of night with joy, and
locking Yellow Dick within the cabin, took up the trail to
Levi Armstrong&rsquo;s hut. His frequent visits to the cabin had
traced a well-defined trail, and as he hurried along, he planned
for the future, which cast gloomy clouds over him&mdash;hunted
man as he was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just let any body touch one o&rsquo; Huldah Armstrong&rsquo;s black
hairs,&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed, aloud. &ldquo;Just let &rsquo;em do it, I
say, and, be he white or red, I&rsquo;ll let a ray of sunshine through
his heart. That girl is just the purest, fairest creature in
New Connecticut, and I&rsquo;m her champion, I am&mdash;Card Belt.
I love that girl,&rdquo; and in the gloaming a crimson flush appeared
on his cheek; &ldquo;but not like a <i>young</i> man. No! I&rsquo;m
old enough to be her father, and I love her because she looks
like Bessie. I often wonder if she will ever have a young
lover. Ah! if she gets down to Strong&rsquo;s, the young bucks
will go up over her face, and they won&rsquo;t be able to drop an
Indian for looking into her eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He communed thus with himself until he reached the creek
near Armstrong&rsquo;s clearing, when the whiz of a bullet broke
his train of thoughts, and brought him to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s close,&rdquo; he ejaculated, glancing at the work made
by the ball in the tree near his head. &ldquo;But a miss is as
good as a mile, and I&rsquo;ll show the greaser that two men can
play with rifles at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment he sunk into the tall grass that lined
the margin of the stream, resolved to outwit his foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to see through the mist,&rdquo; he said, with a broad
smile, a moment after disappearing among the grass. &ldquo;Silver
Hand is up to one of his old tricks again. Curse that Indian!
I&rsquo;ve got to break him of such practices. He shoots too uncommon
close, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a bird-call issued from the trapper&rsquo;s throat, and was
answered from a spot a short distance away, on the opposite
bank of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it was that red-skin,&rdquo; and with the last word the
trapper&rsquo;s cap appeared above the grass. &ldquo;Howsomever it is
best to be cautious&mdash;there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight noise told that the cap had been struck by some
object, and the hunter lowered it to find it perforated by an
arrow of singular workmanship.</p>
<p>Then, placing the cap on his head without withdrawing
the shaft, he rose to his feet simultaneously with the appearance
of a tufted Indian beyond the murky water.</p>
<p>A minute later and the twain had met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Hand, you haven&rsquo;t visited a fellow much o&rsquo; late,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
said Wolf-Cap, looking into the black eyes of the prepossessing
young Wyandot. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t looking for you hereabouts;
but you&rsquo;re the very chap I wanted to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Hand glad to see Wolf-Cap, too,&rdquo; said the Indian.
&ldquo;He much to tell white brother &rsquo;bout the big white coward
in the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about Hull, chief,&rdquo; said the trapper.
&ldquo;I swear away down in my heart when I think of his cowardice.
But we have work to do. The frontiers swarm
with fiends now, and I go to guide a family to Strong&rsquo;s fort.
Of course you&rsquo;re going with me, Silver Hand; we&rsquo;ll talk as
we walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper started forward with a look at the Indian
but the red arm darted forward and touched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf-Cap need go no further&mdash;house empty,&rdquo; said Silver
Hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose house?&rdquo; and a deathly pallor overspread the settler&rsquo;s
face, and told how he dreaded to hear the Wyandot&rsquo;s
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house of the tall old pale-face and pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty, Silver Hand? You must be mistaken. They
were to wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they gone, sure,&rdquo; persisted the chief. &ldquo;Silver Hand
stop at cabin to tell them about the big coward; but he find
nobody in house. The dog, too, was gone; but Silver Hand
find paper on the door&mdash;paper with pale-face words on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief produced a piece of paper from his bosom as he
spoke, and handed it to the trapper.</p>
<p>It was night now, but the light of the rising moon enabled
Wolf-Cap to decipher the rude writing on the sheet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have gone to Strong&rsquo;s with the Logans. We left at
sundown, and you will find us in the old fort.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus read the message on the door, and the trapper bit his
lip when he looked up at the young warrior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe we&rsquo;ll find &rsquo;em there and mebbe we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
said angrily. &ldquo;I guess the Logans were frightened nigh to
death, and would give old Levi no rest, until he promised to
guide them to Strong&rsquo;s. I thought he had a head of his own,
and he promised to wait for me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Wolf-Cap was silent for several moments, and the Indian
regarded him with a puzzled expression of countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When pale-faces leave lodge?&rdquo; he questioned at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At sundown. They&rsquo;re not half-way to Strong&rsquo;s now.
We&rsquo;ll let &rsquo;em go, though, Silver Hand; but we could intercept
them if we wanted to. Old Levi needs a lesson for his
action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his girl too putty to be in the woods at night. Bad
Wyandots and Night-Hawks come down together from the
north, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! that&rsquo;s enough, chief,&rdquo; interrupted the trapper. &ldquo;I
could let old Levi go; but Huldah, never! Come! we kin
catch &rsquo;em at the mouth of Eel Creek, for they&rsquo;ve taken the
black-deer trail to Strong&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;ll take fast travelin&rsquo;, Silver
Hand; but we kin do it. You an&rsquo; me kin do any thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Hand sprung to the task with great eagerness, and
wheeling to the left, the twain hurried down the right bank
of the creek. A rapid march of several hours brought them
to the objective point; and Silver Hand at once dropped upon
all-fours to examine the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Party gone by!&rdquo; he said at last, looking up at the trapper.
&ldquo;Old settler, young man and four squaws. They walkin&rsquo;
fast, too&mdash;almost run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;deuce!&rdquo; exclaimed Wolf-Cap, much chagrined at
the result of their journey. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; with a faint smile of
satisfaction; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they passed this point safely. It argues
well for their arrival at Strong&rsquo;s. How long since did
they pass, Silver Hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wyandot examined the trail again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only little while ago; grass still bent down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we stand some chances of catching them this side
of Strong&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by fast walkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see &rsquo;em inside the fort afore I go back to my hut,&rdquo;
said Wolf-Cap with determination. &ldquo;Royal Funk and me
for it, then, for I tell you, Silver&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distant report of a rifle broke his sentence, and caused
him to shoot an anxious look into the Wyandot&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Three more faint reports followed the first, and Wolf-Cap
was about to spring forward, when Silver Hand thrust him
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
backward toward the rushes that grew about the mouth of the
creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swift tread of feet was heard, and nine dark forms
darted past the couple&rsquo;s concealment, and disappeared in the
darkness that hid from them the flash of the distant rifles.</p>
<p>Without a word, and at the same moment, the trail-hunters
leaped to their feet.</p>
<p>For a moment they listened to the dying footsteps, and
Silver Hand was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf-Cap count &rsquo;em?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. American bullets have spared every Night-Hawk,&rdquo;
grated the trapper. &ldquo;We must call &rsquo;em back,&rdquo; and drawing
a pistol from his belt he discharged it in the air.</p>
<p>The next second the admirable counterfeit of a death-yell
pealed from the Wyandot&rsquo;s throat, and the twain shrunk back
into the rushes again to await the result of their stratagem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; back, chief,&rdquo; said the trapper in a low
tone. &ldquo;Now, come with me. We&rsquo;ll git between &rsquo;em an&rsquo;
our friends if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certain sounds told them that at least a goodly portion of
the outlaws were returning, and silently they entered the
water and waded away.</p>
<p>The sounds of battle toward Strong&rsquo;s had died in the
gloom, and an impenetrable vail of fearful mystery hung over
the fate of the fugitives.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE BATTLE AT STRONG&rsquo;S.</h2>
<p>Strong&rsquo;s block-house so frequently alluded to in the foregoing
pages, had been erected as a place of refuge for the inhabitants
of the &ldquo;fire-lands.&rdquo; It was a large structure, capable
of affording shelter for fifty families, and built with a
view to strength and endurance. The heavy logs were
secured in the old dovetail fashion, and the roof was doubly
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
clapboarded. The second story projected five feet over the
first, thus enabling the defenders to fire upon any foe that
might attempt to force the lower doors. The Huron river lay
fifty yards from the front palisade of the block-house, which
stood at the foot of a hill, cleared by the settlers&rsquo; axes.</p>
<p>The bottom of the hill was selected for the building site,
owing to the proximity of water, and a well also yielded the
life-giving fluid within the fort. The strong palisade that
surrounded the &ldquo;house of refuge,&rdquo; was a double security, and
the settlers felt proud of their work when completed. A
stalwart settler named Zebulon Strong had superintended the
erection of the stronghold, hence its rather imposing cognomen.</p>
<p>There were other block-houses in the &ldquo;fire-lands&rdquo;; but
none were near enough to afford assistance to Strong&rsquo;s in a
case of imminent danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the families are all in now,&rdquo; said Zebulon Strong,
to a young man who was standing by a loop-hole, in the
second story of the backwoods fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in, captain? bless you, no. The Logans are out yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And old Levi Armstrong, too,&rdquo; said another settler, who,
standing near, had caught the brief conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is Levi; I had overlooked him,&rdquo; the youth remarked
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and the Logans do not rightly belong here,&rdquo; said
Strong. &ldquo;Levi lent Throop a hand at his fort down on
Massanga creek, and there he belongs. He will take the Logans
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But should he ask admittance here, you will not refuse,
captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our quota of families is full now. We can&rsquo;t accommodate
another,&rdquo; answered Strong, with the air of a man elevated
by a small command. &ldquo;And, besides, I am confident
that we are surrounded now. The girls maintain that they
caught a glimpse of Indians at the river, and I, myself, have
seen feathers on the top of the hill. They wait for the opening
of the gates; but nothing under heaven can induce me to
please them in that particular. We&rsquo;ve a good supply of
water, and I tell you, sir, that the gates don&rsquo;t open again until
the danger is passed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The foregoing conversation occurred on the night of Levi
Armstrong&rsquo;s abandonment of his cabin, and Zebulon Strong&rsquo;s
mien told that he was determined to adhere to his determination
at all hazards.</p>
<p>Johnny Appleseed had performed a noble duty. Those
whom he had warned allowed no grass to grow under their
feet. While he yet lingered in sight of the uncouth cabin, it
was deserted, and its inmates were flying toward Strong&rsquo;s
fort. All those who claimed shelter beneath its roof had
caused their names to be registered in the commandant&rsquo;s book,
so, when the last registered family had passed the palisades,
the gates were closed and barred.</p>
<p>The appearance of the Indians quickly followed the strange
man&rsquo;s warning. They had executed forced marches from
Detroit, hoping to reach the &ldquo;fire-lands&rdquo; in advance of tidings
of the surrender; but found themselves outwitted. This
disappointment only strengthened their desire for blood, and
on the evening that followed the gathering at the fort, they
made their presence known.</p>
<p>After declaring that the gates should open no more until
the danger had passed, Captain Zebulon Strong left the two
men, the younger of whom turned to the loop-hole looking
upon the level plain, that stretched from the block-house to
the river. The moon was shining brightly, and from his
elevated position he caught the shimmer of the Huron&rsquo;s
waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen no Indian feathers,&rdquo; he murmured, sweeping
the bank with his eye. &ldquo;The captain is getting too arbitrary
of late. It&rsquo;s all well enough to be cautious; but this thing
of barring the gates against our fellow-men won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last word was spoken in an underbreath, for the crack
of rifles smote his ears, and instantly the block-house was a
scene of confusion.</p>
<p>The reports sounded terribly distinct on the night air, and
seemed to emanate from a spot about three hundred yards
down the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your senses, women!&rdquo; was heard the stern, hoarse
voice of Zebulon Strong, and the look which he threw upon
the timid ones forced them into quietude. &ldquo;We are not attacked
yet. When the devils have forced the palisades and
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
swarm up-stairs, then there will be time for shrieks. What
do you see, Harmon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interrogative was addressed to the youth with whom
he had conversed a short time before, and the motion of the
young man&rsquo;s hand caused the commandant to step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look through this loop, captain,&rdquo; said Mark Harmon,
stepping aside. &ldquo;Look down the river. The Indians have
fired on some fugitives, and they run for their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zebulon Strong put his eyes to the loop-hole, and saw four
dark figures running toward the fort. The foremost was a
man, who carried a dark, human-shaped object over his left
shoulder; the others, seemingly, were women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the gates and let &rsquo;em in!&rdquo; cried a voice, and presently
the same words were heard on all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> command this block-house!&rdquo; and with a livid face and
flashing eyeballs, Zebulon Strong sprung from the loop and
wheeled upon his people. &ldquo;The gates don&rsquo;t open till <i>I</i> give
the order. The Indians are ready for a rush so soon as the
gates grind ajar. Every stump on the plain shelters a red-skin.
No, the gates don&rsquo;t open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the fugitives are the Logans and the Armstrongs!&rdquo;
remonstrated Mark Harmon, biting his lip with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They belong at Throop&rsquo;s!&rdquo; hoarsely hissed the captain.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be massacred if we open the gates to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better die for an act of mercy than outraging the dictates
of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A contemptuous sneer came to the captain&rsquo;s lips, and as he
turned to the port-hole again he drew a pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill the next man who talks of opening the gates this
night,&rdquo; he said, fiercely. &ldquo;The fugitives might have been safe
at Throop&rsquo;s; let them pay for their decision at our palisades,
if it comes to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women shrunk to the space allotted to them with epithets
of &ldquo;monster,&rdquo; &ldquo;fiend,&rdquo; and the like, falling from their
lips, and the men exchanged looks of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will reach the gates before their pursuers!&rdquo; cried a
watcher at a port-hole, joyously; but the words fell on blank
ears, for the gates, alas! through the inhumanity of one man,
would not be open to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Levi is carrying his daughter,&rdquo; said a second settler.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
&ldquo;John Logan is not with them; he must have been shot down
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sight of the brave fugitives almost at his gates, and
hard pressed by a savage foe, did not soften Captain Strong&rsquo;s
heart, in which cowardice and personal fear burrowed like a
ground-hog.</p>
<p>The pale faces of the fugitives were visible in the moonlight,
and all at once a cry came from the very shadow of the
palisades:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the gates!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zebulon Strong turned from the port-hole and halloed to
the guards below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch the gates closely. Kill the first man who attempts
to open them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, captain!&rdquo; responded a voice from the darkness
below, and the commandant was rising erect when Mark Harmon
leaped upon him.</p>
<p>The young frontiersman was almost as strong as the captain,
and he bore him to the puncheons before he could resist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it comes to this, captain,&rdquo; he said, beckoning
several men to his assistance. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to let women
die at our doors when we can save them. Now lie still
until we release you, or by heavens we&rsquo;ll turn you without the
fort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other hands than the young borderman&rsquo;s now seized the
captain, who soon relinquished his struggles, and Harmon
sprung to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Mark!&rdquo; cried a man at a port-hole. &ldquo;Quick!
they&rsquo;re thundering at the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant the youth had disappeared, and six stalwart
bordermen vanished with him like a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helpless friends are at the gate!&rdquo; he cried, as, pistol in
hand, he sprung toward the sentries. &ldquo;We command this
fort now. Stand back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentries, instead of retreating, flew to the work of unbarring
the clumsy gate, and in a moment the work was accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no mercy, Captain Strong?&rdquo; cried Levi Armstrong&rsquo;s
voice, while the eight men worked at the fastenings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;in a minute we&rsquo;ll save you,&rdquo; shouted young
Harmon, and when the gate flew open he was the first to
leap forward.</p>
<p>As he did so, full twenty dark forms rose from behind as
many stumps, and the next second, a volley poured in at the
gate.</p>
<p>Two of the rescuers staggered back, and Mark Harmon,
uninjured, but with a wounded girl in his arms, turned to the
gate again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! they are charging you!&rdquo; shouted a dozen agonized
voices from the upper portion of the block-house; but such
words were unnecessary, for the men at the gate comprehended
their danger.</p>
<p>The clearing seemed literally covered with savages, and
between the foremost and the bordermen a terrible fight was
progressing at the palisades. A volley was poured into the
red ranks from the port-holes, and a number fell; but the
greater portion of the settlers had rushed below, and were
trying to beat the red-skins from the gate that it might be
closed.</p>
<p>At last, after half an hour of the most desperate fighting
on record, the ponderous gate was swung to again and barred;
and with blows indicative of future vengeance, on the heavy
oaken boards, the Indians retreated to cover.</p>
<p>Twelve of their number had fallen in the attack, while no
less than ten of the bordermen, or one fourth of the fort&rsquo;s
defenders, lay dead between the palisades and the strong
logs.</p>
<p>But the mission of humanity had resulted in success!</p>
<p>Levi Armstrong, his daughter Huldah, and the Logan girls
were safe, for a while at least, behind strong timbers; but
the yells of their foes told the settlers that the Wyandot
looked upon his defeat in the light of success.</p>
<p>He had reduced the number of the fort&rsquo;s defenders, when
not a single man could be spared, while the loss of his twelve
braves would not be felt by the hundreds that still remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Strong,&rdquo; said Mark Harmon after the fight, &ldquo;we
are willing to restore you to your command, for we honor
your experience in Indian warfare. Humanity compelled us
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
to treat you as we have. <i>Now</i> we are willing that the gates
shall remain closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say you were,&rdquo; said Zebulon Strong, with an ill-concealed
sneer, as he glanced at the dead bordermen who
had been borne into the fort, prior to burial. &ldquo;I will take
command again. I&rsquo;m to be obeyed in every thing after this.
We are besieged now, and like men we will die, if die we
must, together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His speech was greeted with applause, and many despairing
ones took new hope; but Levi Armstrong whispered to
Mark Harmon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain must be watched. He hasn&rsquo;t begun to forgive
you fellers for savin&rsquo; our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Zebulon Strong resumed command of the fort, its defensive
resources were thoroughly inspected, and the dead
buried.</p>
<p>The settlers knew that the siege would be pushed with the
utmost vigor, and that every Indian artifice would be used to
place them at the mercy of the tomahawk.</p>
<p>They could not look to final success, for their supply of
water was meager, and the whole Indian force of the &ldquo;fire-lands&rdquo;
could be brought to bear against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one man whom we should have with us,&rdquo; remarked
a young settler, in the presence of Captain Strong,
shortly after the burial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked a dozen voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf-Cap. I tell you he&rsquo;s worth a dozen rifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, a hundred,&rdquo; said Mark Harmon. &ldquo;If he and Silver
Hand were in the fort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get along without &rsquo;em,&rdquo; grated Strong, shooting a
fierce look at the young frontiersman. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fight our own
battle without the aid of illegal squatters and Indians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His last sentence was uttered in a subdued tone, as he
turned from the group, and other men than the old settler
and Mark Harmon thought that the captain would bear
watching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />CAUGHT.</h2>
<p>Wolf-Cap entertained several good reasons for suggesting
Strong&rsquo;s fort as a place of refuge for the Armstrong family.
Throop&rsquo;s block-house was nearer the settler&rsquo;s cabin than
Strong&rsquo;s; but the latter was better adapted for defense. It
was the strongest post in the &ldquo;fire-lands,&rdquo; and the trapper assured
himself that Zebulon Strong would receive the fugitives
with open arms, and hail the settler&rsquo;s presence with joy.</p>
<p>Left to his own choice, Levi Armstrong would have sought
shelter at Throop&rsquo;s, which post his hands had helped to rear,
and consequently he could well claim protection there. The
Logans, too, belonged to Throop&rsquo;s; but fearful lest the little
block-house, illy-defended, would soon succumb to the red
tomahawk, they resolved to seek Strong&rsquo;s. As the sequel will
show, they would have fared better at the first-named fort.</p>
<p>The band of six fugitives, after leaving the Armstrong
cabin, traveled fast. Levi counseled a delay till the arrival
of Wolf-Cap; but John Logan and his sisters would listen to
no such counsel, and the settler therefore broke his promise
to the trapper.</p>
<p>The mouth of Eel Creek was reached, and the Huron
crossed in safety, and the fears of the fugitives began to subside.</p>
<p>Strong&rsquo;s fort would soon be reached, and then they could
bid defiance to the fiends of the fire-lands.</p>
<p>But suddenly, while pushing down the left bank of the
Huron, the report of a rifle saluted their ears, and John Logan
fell to rise no more. Instantly the settler turned to combat
his foes, when three more shots were poured into their little
ranks by the hidden enemies, and then the fugitives, knowing
themselves near Strong&rsquo;s and ahead of the slayers, turned and
fled.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the little party escaped injury by the second
volley; but Levi lifted his daughter from the ground, and
bore her, shielded by his body, to the frontier fort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The Indians kept near the fugitives, but did not attempt to
make a capture. They seemed bent on the success of some
stratagem, which was seen by the whites at the eleventh hour.
The fort was already invested by a powerful force of savages
fresh from the victory at Detroit, and certain signals told the
settlers&rsquo; pursuers of well-laid plans. But the bravery of the
fort&rsquo;s defenders had defeated the stratagem, as the reader has
seen; but not without the loss of valuable men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, chief! In the name of Heaven, listen to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was Card Belt, and it was the volley fired by
the stump-sheltered savages at the opening of Strong&rsquo;s gates,
that called forth his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians attack fort,&rdquo; said the Wyandot, in his native
tongue. &ldquo;White people get to gates, and when they open,
Indians shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a real battle is raging. Hark! I hear the yells of
the Indians. Come! we&rsquo;ll go and help the boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the chief slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use go there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help pale-faces,&rdquo;
and standing in the shadows of several giant trees, the couple
listened to the sound of battle.</p>
<p>The trapper, while he listened, acknowledged the strength
of Silver Hand&rsquo;s counsel. He believed that Fort Strong was
invested, and knew that, for the present, they could render
no assistance to its inmates. In the future, they might be
able to help them.</p>
<p>At last the couple heard the yells of the beaten savages,
and exchanged looks of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know whether Levi and his girl got into Strong&rsquo;s
or not,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap, with an anxious expression of countenance.
&ldquo;Silver Hand, they&rsquo;d better not touch one o&rsquo; Huldah
Armstrong&rsquo;s hairs. I say I&rsquo;ll kill the first fellar what
does&mdash;there! I should judge that its pretty near midnight
now,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause, during which the Indian
made no attempt to speak. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be movin&rsquo; somewhere.
The fellars what we fooled down on Eel Creek haven&rsquo;t
passed yet; but mebbe they&rsquo;ve joined their red brethren
by another route. They could do that, you know. The troubles
of Strong&rsquo;s fort has begun now, and we&rsquo;ve got to help
&rsquo;em, somehow or other. But first, let&rsquo;s go down to my hut
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
and stir up a few eatables. Besides, I want to see if every
thing&rsquo;s right thar, and to liberate Yellow Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wyandot acquiesced in the trapper&rsquo;s proposition, and
a moment later the spot was deserted.</p>
<p>Silver Hand belonged to the same nation that besieged Fort
Strong with malicious intent. During the Revolutionary war
the Wyandots divided; a faction headed by the celebrated
Captain Pipe aided the British, while the minor division, under
the leadership of White Eyes, sided with the colonies.
The factions refused to come together after the war, so when
the second trouble with English oppression sought the combat
of lead and steel, the unreconciled Indians resumed their
old relations. The English Wyandots, led by Splitlog and
Roundhead joined Proctor&rsquo;s forces, while the friends of the
United States opposed them. To the latter party Silver Hand
belonged.</p>
<p>He was present at the encounter of Hull, but effected his
escape after that catastrophe, and hastened to his old hunting-grounds&mdash;the
fire-lands.</p>
<p>The white trapper and his staunch red ally reached the vicinity
of the proscribed cabin during that period of darkness
preceding dawn.</p>
<p>The skies were darkened overhead, for the moon had disappeared,
and the scene was made quite dismal by the ominous
hootings of a great owl perched upon the cone of the
hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are too still here for me, Silver Hand,&rdquo; whispered
the trapper, in his cautious tone, when they had halted near
the solitary hut. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come home at all times o&rsquo; nights and
mornin&rsquo;s, but never afore hev I see&rsquo;d an owl on the roof. Jest
listen to &rsquo;im. Why I kin hear &rsquo;im say &lsquo;go away&rsquo; as plainly
as I hear his voice. No, chief, I don&rsquo;t rush into the old hut
jist now. We&rsquo;re on the edge of a trap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Hand did not appear to hear the trapper&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>His body was bent forward, and he was trying to discern
the minuti&aelig; of the cabin and its immediate vicinity. But the
darkness baffled him.</p>
<p>For the period of an hour the twain crouched, like bowlders,
in their place of concealment, and then Wolf-Cap moved
forward, leaving the Indian to await his return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>He approached the cabin until the owl suddenly vacated
his perch, and hied away to the forest. Quickly but noiselessly,
then, the trapper returned to his ally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owl gone,&rdquo; said Silver Hand, before the white man could
find a tongue. &ldquo;Who scared &rsquo;im?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell you, chief. My cabin
is inhabited. I know it, and somebody from the inside frightened
that owl. I know that the bird didn&rsquo;t leave of his own
accord, and he didn&rsquo;t see a mouse, either. Now, I&rsquo;m going
to find out who&rsquo;s taken possession of the hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon a series of snake-like movements were inaugurated
by the couple, who succeeded in passing around the cabin
without discovering a foe.</p>
<p>Whoever was in the hut kept very quiet, and the mystery
deepened with each succeeding moment.</p>
<p>His dog&rsquo;s silence increased Wolf-Cap&rsquo;s suspicion of foul-play.
Yellow Dick had always greeted his return with a peculiar
cry; but now the death of silence reigned, and the
trapper had touched the wall of his old home without eliciting
any noise from the dog.</p>
<p>A second inspection of the clearing and adjacent forest followed
the first, and then Wolf-Cap turned suddenly upon the
Indian, with compressed lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand it any longer,&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;The rascal&rsquo;s
got to show himself now. Watch everywhere, chief,
while I oust &rsquo;im. If I don&rsquo;t do it, the Night-Hawks
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last sentence was spoken in an undertone; and with
a quantity of light brushwood the trapper moved toward the
cabin.</p>
<p>By the help of steps cut in the logs he ascended to the roof,
and deposited his burden between the dry clapboards. Then
he sprinkled a quantity of powder among the combustible
stuff, and ignited the whole with his flints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he exclaimed, springing to the ground and glancing
up at the fire taking firm hold on the clapboards. &ldquo;Now,
I fancy as how the fellow will show himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His surmises proved correct.</p>
<p>The tenants of his cabin did show themselves. The roof
of the cabin was soon in a blaze, and the twain watched the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
door with ready rifles. A lurid light overspread the clearing,
and bathed the bosom of the river in romantic beauty.</p>
<p>By and by the trapper began to think that, after all, he had
surmised incorrectly, for the howls of a dog emanated from
the burning building. Silver Hand listened to the cries, the
suspicious part of his nature fully aroused, and himself undecided
how to act.</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap wanted to save his dog, and the Indian noted
the working of his face in the firelight that stole to their retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Hand, I&rsquo;ve been taken in,&rdquo; said Belt, suddenly. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t hear Dick howl that way. By Huron! he shan&rsquo;t cry
for mercy when <i>I</i> am about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why he keep still so long?&rdquo; retorted Silver Hand,
quickly. &ldquo;Trapper answer that if he kin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether Wolf-Cap caught the gist of the
Wyandot&rsquo;s sentences, for he jerked his arm from the red fingers
that encircled it, and rushed in to the firelight.</p>
<p>The thought of his noble dog&mdash;the guardian of his life and
home for many years&mdash;cooped up within a blazing building,
blinded him to the arguments of caution, and the Indian muttered
an oath and leaped to his feet when he saw that Wolf-Cap
was gone!</p>
<p>The daring trapper had reached the path that led from his
door to a spring near the river, when he suddenly paused.</p>
<p>A strange and suspicious voice beyond the logs had startled
him.</p>
<p>It sounded like a man&rsquo;s voice, and his acute senses had already
shaped it into the words, &ldquo;All ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not time to turn to join Silver Hand nor to signal
him. He was within six feet of the cabin door, and was
looking to his rifle, when the ponderous oaken portal swung
wide, and five stalwart fellows threw themselves upon him.</p>
<p>They&mdash;the Night-Hawks&mdash;were the tenants of his cabin!</p>
<p>He retreated a step, and delivered a shot that stretched one
man upon the ground, and then, after a desperate struggle, he
was secured and his weapons taken from him.</p>
<p>Silver Hand lent no assistance to his friend; and his assistance
would have availed the trapper nothing. Therefore
the chief&rsquo;s disappearance was not a sign of cowardice; on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
contrary it was a sign of good judgment, big with assurances
of future help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, cabin-burner, you have bid defiance to the Night-Hawks,&rdquo;
said the spokesman of the outlaws, pointing to the
paper still visible on the cabin door: &ldquo;No block-house shall
shelter me. I spare not, and no mercy ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wild laugh greeted this quotation from the trapper&rsquo;s defiance,
and the outlaws crowded near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men, I mean every word I have written on my door,&rdquo;
he said, calmly. &ldquo;There war nine of ye; there ar&rsquo; but eight
now,&rdquo; and here his glance fell upon the man whom he had
shot dead. &ldquo;I war willin&rsquo; to take the odds ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; me for I
am no illegal squatter, and I hate outlaws. Royal Funk, I
am free to confess that you&rsquo;ve got the upper hand now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to keep it, Card Belt,&rdquo; replied the desperado,
with a smile. &ldquo;I posted a fair warning on your door
last night. &lsquo;Fly or die,&rsquo; it said. You would not fly, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must die, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&mdash;now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We&rsquo;re going to take you down to the Indians at
Fort Strong, and I guess the Night-Hawks will treat the settlers
to a public execution. You and Silver Hand played it
on us to-night. We were following the Armstrongs when
you called us back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you came down here and hid in the old cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s my dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A twitch of pain followed by an angry pallor, came to the
trapper&rsquo;s lips, and the light of vengeance flashed in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Frank, let&rsquo;s be goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said one of the outlaws at
this juncture. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis gettin&rsquo; day, an&rsquo; Splitlog may need us at
Strong&rsquo;s. We want to be there at the death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that moment you must wait a long time,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap,
addressing the leader of the Night-Hawks. &ldquo;Strong&rsquo;s
is prepared to stand a desperate siege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; but its fate is inevitable. Card Belt, so sure as
the sun rises this day, Strong&rsquo;s fort shall be given to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
flames, and its inmates, all save one, to the tomahawk. We
are determined to depopulate &lsquo;the fire-lands.&rsquo; Why man,
four hundred Indians invest the fort at this hour. How can
it escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can! it shall!&rdquo; cried the trapper. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; and his
tone softened, &ldquo;but you say that one person in Strong&rsquo;s
shall not die. Pray, Royal Funk, who is to be thus favored?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A certain woman&mdash;my lady-love,&rdquo; said the outlaw, striking
a ridiculous attitude, with his head thrown back, and his
thumbs inserted into the sides of his hunting-frock just below
the armpits. &ldquo;What! didn&rsquo;t you know I was in love, Wolf-Cap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all these brave fellows know it. They&rsquo;ve patted
me on the back and said, &lsquo;Go it, Roy.&rsquo; But the mirth of the
whole matter is, Belt, that I&rsquo;ve never told my love to her.
She&rsquo;s ignorant of my passion, and you see I must get her out
of Strong&rsquo;s so as to breathe it softly into her ears. Old Levi
might object; but <i>I generally marry orphans</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite his anticipations, Wolf-Cap started when the
identity of the outlaw&rsquo;s love was declared.</p>
<p>What! should Royal Funk, the Night-Hawk captain, possess
Huldah Armstrong?</p>
<p>Not, thought Wolf-Cap, if he could prevent him. But he
was under sentence of death, and stood in the shadow of the
Terror&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>Half an hour after the capture of Wolf-Cap, the Night-Hawks
started to join the besiegers of Strong&rsquo;s fort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />THE OUTCROPPINGS OF TREASON.</h2>
<p>When the flush of day broke upon Strong&rsquo;s fort, not a foe
was to be seen.</p>
<p>The numerous stumps in the clearing sheltered no feathered
head; but the whites knew that their enemies had not raised
the siege. The greater portion of the dusky besiegers had
withdrawn to the river bank, while large numbers lay behind
the hill, in the rear of the fort.</p>
<p>But, as the light became stronger, the defenders caught
glimpses of tufts of feathers along the river; but no shots
were fired.</p>
<p>In the opinion of several settlers, the perilous situation of
affairs called for a council of war, and accordingly Captain
Strong, much against his will, was induced to convene such
an assembly. The council met in the lower room of the
fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men,&rdquo; said Strong, who could not conceal his ill-humor,
&ldquo;as I have said, I see no necessity for this council. I thought
<i>I</i> was director of affairs here, and when Indians are to be
dealt with, I know what to do. But I will listen to any suggestions
you may offer, and, if I like, will adopt them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several old &ldquo;fire-lands&rdquo; men shook their heads gravely at
the captain&rsquo;s words; but made no reply.</p>
<p>Mark Harmon, the young frontiersman, opened the council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we need a new well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a well, sir,&rdquo; said Strong, tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to forget that we have depended on the river
for much water. That supply is effectually cut off now, and
our sole well will not supply the demand in case the fort
should be set on fire with blazing arrows. We are in for a
desperate siege; the result of the gate battle has exasperated
our foes, and they will leave no hellish contrivance for our
capture untried. I look for terrible times to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you will not be disappointed, Harmon,&rdquo; said an old
gray-haired settler. &ldquo;We stand on the edge of a crater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I anticipate but little hardship,&rdquo; said Strong,
who had listened to the young scout, with a clearly defined
sneer. &ldquo;The Wyandots will abandon the siege before two
days, for there are other forts weaker than ours. Throop&rsquo;s,
Martin&rsquo;s, and Westfall&rsquo;s can not withstand a siege. Knowing
this, the Indians will desert us for them; then, during their
absence, we can strengthen our own resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, captain, that an attack should be made to-night,
and our roof be set on fire,&rdquo; said Levi Armstrong. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
said that there are but two feet of water in the well now, and
none flowing in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The statement is not correct,&rdquo; retorted Strong, quickly.
&ldquo;Yesterday I fathomed four feet of water, and more was entering.
The well is a good one, and can not be dipped dry.
I know whereof I speak; therefore my positiveness, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The council broke up without a command being given for
a new well. A number of the settlers sided with Zebulon
Strong; but a wary few felt that the proposed well was an
absolute want.</p>
<p>However, Mark Harmon got a guard over their water supply,
and each family received a certain quantity of the
precious fluid. The stubbornness of the captain was the cause
of much comment; but as he was an old woodman and knew
much of Indian sieges, it was generally admitted that he knew
best, and so the day wore on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we will be attacked to-night, Mr. Harmon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker&rsquo;s mellow tones denoted her to be Huldah Armstrong,
and she looked anxiously into the borderer&rsquo;s face as
she asked the question. They stood near a port-hole that
looked at the hills, behind whose bare summit the sun had
just disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look for bloodshed before dawn,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The savages
would have us believe that they have deserted the vicinity;
but they still remain. They are not going to raise the
siege so soon after its inauguration, Miss Armstrong.&rdquo; And
then glancing through the port he quickly changed the subject.
&ldquo;But your run for life was perilous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and, Mr. Harmon, father says we owe our lives to
your daring. Therefore, let me thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blushed to his temples and averted his eyes, which had
returned to her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks, Miss Armstrong. The brave fellows who
fought at the gates are the heroes, not I. But I am rejoiced
to see you safe after such a noble run for life. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A flag&mdash;a flag!&rdquo; was the cry that broke the youth&rsquo;s sentence,
and drew his eye to the musket port again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live, Miss Armstrong, our foes are treating us to a
flag of truce,&rdquo; he said, his eyes still riveted upon several figures
that had suddenly appeared on the top of the hill. &ldquo;This
is an action by me entirely unexpected. What can it
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Strong was soon notified of the approach of the
flag, and watched it through one of the openings.</p>
<p>His face worked strangely while he looked, and there was
the light of vengeance in his large, sloe-black eyes. But he
kept his face near the port, so that no one in the fort could
study its expressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they demand a surrender, of course you will refuse to
comply, captain,&rdquo; ventured an old settler, who stood near the
borderman.</p>
<p>Instantly, with a face crimsoned with rage, Zebulon
Strong wheeled from the little embrasure:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to be dictated to on every hand?&rdquo; he cried, appealing
to the inmates of the apartment. &ldquo;If I am captain here
merely in name, I want to know it. I know a thing or two,
and if I am to be advised by every frightened man and woman
in the fort, you can take my broken sword, and elect another
commander. What! surrender to yon horde of butcherers?
Never. When they take Fort Strong, there shall be
no living soul to torture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud cheer greeted Strong&rsquo;s final words, and cries of,
&ldquo;We want no other captain!&rdquo; &ldquo;Do what you please!&rdquo; resounded
on every side.</p>
<p>So the officer sheathed the Revolutionary sword which he
had drawn, and turned to see that the bearers of the flag of
truce had halted about twenty yards from the palisades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! Captain Strong,&rdquo; came a loud and clear voice from
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
the little group, and it was seen that the speaker was a white
man clad in the full scarlet uniform of a British officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is wanting?&rdquo; answered Strong, through the
embrasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are surrounded by nine hundred Indians, and four
hundred of his majesty&rsquo;s troops,&rdquo; said the spokesman of the
flag-bearers. &ldquo;Colonel O&rsquo;Neill, commander of the combined
forces, desires to spare the effusion of noble blood, and therefore
summons you to surrender at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon what terms?&rdquo; asked Strong, as a murmur of defiance
ran through the ranks of the fort&rsquo;s defenders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your people will be permitted to depart in peace; but
the fort, of course, will be destroyed,&rdquo; said the Briton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine hundred Indians and four hundred British,&rdquo; said
Strong, turning to his men after the Englishman&rsquo;s last words.
&ldquo;I did not think the odds were so terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soldier lies!&rdquo; cried Levi Armstrong, stepping forward.
&ldquo;He has spoken to terrify us, and the quarter we would receive
is the quarter given to Captain Heald at Chicago. Bordermen,
remember that massacre of men, women and children.
Shall we surrender?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; rung on every side, and Captain Strong&rsquo;s face
assumed the hue of ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your answer?&rdquo; cried the English officer, his impatience
manifest in his voice. &ldquo;Colonel O&rsquo;Neill pledges his
word of honor as a soldier of his majesty&rsquo;s army, that the
tomahawk shall be withheld in the event of a quick surrender.
He can control the Wyandots, and he will. If the
commander of your fort is Zebulon Strong, he then knows
Colonel Argent O&rsquo;Neill to be a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Argent O&rsquo;Neill&mdash;I know him,&rdquo; said the captain.
&ldquo;But my men refuse to surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel O&rsquo;Neill speaks to Captain Strong&mdash;not to his
men,&rdquo; returned the soldier, proudly; but with a sneer of contempt
in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to your commander and tell him that Fort Strong
will be the abode of the dead when he takes it. We know a
Briton&rsquo;s promise to be but another name for a lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last speaker was Mark Harmon, and his words were
applauded as he turned from the embrasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to answer him,&rdquo; said Strong, in a hoarse
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is answered!&rdquo; was the young borderman&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>The captain bit his lips and turned to the port again as
the British officer spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The consequences be upon your own head, Captain
Strong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have performed my duty; you have refused
to perform yours. My colonel will give the conduct of
the siege to the Indians now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the speaker turned abruptly on his heel, and
the flag of truce disappeared over the brow of the hill.</p>
<p>A minute later the flash of a musket and the thud of a
bullet told the defenders of Fort Strong that the battle had
opened.</p>
<p>A single gun from the fort sent a defiance to the hidden
foes, and for the space of an hour quiet reigned.</p>
<p>Captain Strong now seemed eager to defend the block-house
to the last, and exchanged words of encouragement
with the settlers as he inspected the defenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re in for it, now, Morgan,&rdquo; he said, in a low
tone, to a burly fellow stationed near the gate where, a few
hours before, so much blood had been shed. &ldquo;They refuse
to surrender, and now your part of the work comes. Are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the sentry, glancing around. &ldquo;The darkness
will aid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you scale the wall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily from the inside here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make haste. You know the signal. I will do the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Strong slipped a piece of paper into the guard&rsquo;s
hand as he spoke the last word, and turned away.</p>
<p>The next moment Morgan Sawyer scaled the pickets, and
dropped to the ground on the outer side!</p>
<p>Then he ran toward the hill under cover of the intense
darkness. For dense clouds obscured the sky from horizon
to horizon, thus effectually blotting out the light of the moon.</p>
<p>Captain Strong had hardly gained the interior of the fort,
when Sawyer&rsquo;s escape was discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! a traitor among us?&rdquo; cried the commander,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
counterfeiting indignation and surprise to an admirable degree.
&ldquo;And at the gate, too! Harmon and Cole, at once to the
portals! I know <i>you</i> can be trusted. Matt Hunter, you will
take Isaac&rsquo;s place at the well. Curse Morg Sawyer! may the
fiends scalp him for his treachery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The commander&rsquo;s wish was echoed by more than one determined
settler, who waited for the onslaught of the savages.</p>
<p>The men at the embrasures listened and looked for their
foes, and Zebulon Strong walked uneasily about, listening all
the time for a certain sound.</p>
<p>Once or twice he pushed the long black locks from his
ears, and paused for a moment at one of the ports.</p>
<p>Suddenly a pistol-shot came from the hill, then another,
and another.</p>
<p>Strong was descending to the first floor of the block-house
when the sounds fell upon his ears, and he paused in the center
of the ladder with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morg has succeeded,&rdquo; he said, in the lowest of mutterings.
&ldquo;Now let Hunter do his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pistol-shots died away, and no volley of musketry followed.</p>
<p>In the dim light of the candles, old Levi Armstrong looked
at Mark Harmon and moved to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think now?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foe on the hill is signaling the foe by the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus you interpret the shots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I differ. They are the result of Morg Sawyer&rsquo;s treason.
This roof still shelters his confederates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young hunter caught the settler&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, whom do you suspect?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Tell me. We must act at once if we have traitors in our
midst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man bent nearer to reply, when the whiz of a
burning arrow startled him, and caused him to spring to the
embrasure.</p>
<p>But the fiery missile missed the fort, and quivered in a
stump near the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now take the buckets, men!&rdquo; cried the voice of Captain
Strong. &ldquo;We must fight fire with water!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Instantly a score of stout leathern buckets were brought
into requisition, and the boards that covered the well removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little water for the women, first,&rdquo; said Levi Armstrong,
dropping one of the buckets into the well by means of a
rope.</p>
<p>Down, down went the receptacle, and the men stood about
with anxious faces. They wanted to know how much water
was in the well, for upon a generous supply of the fluid, their
lives and the lives of their wives and little ones depended.</p>
<p>At last the bucket was heard to strike water, and old Levi
looked up almost despairingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s scarcely two feet o&rsquo; water in the well,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fathomed four last night,&rdquo; said Zebulon Strong, confidently.
&ldquo;But quick! draw up, Armstrong, and let more
buckets be lowered. The burning arrows shoot from the hill
like meteors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant the water was at the top, and the settler
threw the rope to Matt Hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is for the women,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll taste
it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised the bucket to his lips, but a moment later ejected
the mouthful of water which he had taken, and started toward
the well, with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let nobody swallow a drop of that water!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It
has been poisoned, and the poisoner is still sheltered by the
roof of Fort Strong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect of the startling words was utterly indescribable.
It could not have been equaled by the sudden dropping of a
thunderbolt into the fort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />WITHOUT THE FORT.</h2>
<p>During the brief period of time that intervened between
the battle at the gates and the discharge of blazing arrows at
the fort itself, the beautiful fire-lands had not escaped the vengeance
of the settlers&rsquo; enemies.</p>
<p>The deserted cabins were given over to the mercies of the
torch, and the work of months perished in a few hours. The
red burners were accompanied by British soldiers, who outdid
the fiends of the forest in heartless ferocity, and at nightfall
they returned to the besiegers loaded with plunder and glutted
with diabolism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you going to do with your man, now that
you&rsquo;ve got him?&rdquo; asked Colonel O&rsquo;Neill of Royal Funk, when
the outlaw reappeared at the British head-quarters, fresh from
the work of destruction above referred to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I going to do with &rsquo;im, colonel? Why, I&rsquo;ll tell
you. It was my intention to execute &rsquo;im on top o&rsquo; the hill,
yesterday; but I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. There&rsquo;s a girl in Fort
Strong&mdash;a girl whom I want&mdash;Huldah Armstrong, and strange
to say, Card Belt wants her, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I see,&rdquo; said the British officer, with a smile. &ldquo;He
is your rival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, colonel; but I hold the best hand now, as you will
admit by glancing at the cards. We are bound to take the
fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be ours before another sunset. You know what
Strong is doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrews told me, an hour since. But can we rely on
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill, assuringly, and with emphasis.
&ldquo;Strong, at the heart, is a coward, yet he will do desperate
things. He was a secret Tory in Herkimer county, New York,
during the Revolution, and while campaigning in that region,
I became acquainted with him. More than once he furnished

me with valuable information concerning the movements of
the enemy, and I believe that the rebels never suspected him.
His loyalty to King George has never for a moment abated.
I tell you we have a friend in Fort Strong, without whom we
could do nothing. For Splitlog was about to relinquish the
siege when the deserter reached our camp with Strong&rsquo;s proposition.
Now the Indians will stay with us. But the thread
of your story has been broken. I want to know what you
are going to do with the squatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you in a few words,&rdquo; answered the leader of
the Night-Hawks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry Huldah Armstrong
in his presence, after the Wyandot fashion, and then&mdash;why,
then I&rsquo;m going to dispose of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the Wyandot fashion, also, I suppose,&rdquo; smiled the
colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Funk, returning the smile. &ldquo;When do you
open the battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians are preparing the fiery arrows now,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;Ha! there goes one, already!&rdquo; and the colonel&rsquo;s
hand directed the outlaw&rsquo;s gaze to a blazing arrow shooting
toward the fort.</p>
<p>It was quickly followed by another and another, until a
perfect shower of fiery missiles rained upon the fort.</p>
<p>But the firm and dry clap-boards that formed the roof resisted
nobly, and the arrows rebounded and dropped into the
yard below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get the arrows <i>under</i> the boards,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill,
turning to the chief, Splitlog, who stood at his side. &ldquo;Send
some of your bravest Wyandots nearer the fort, and tell them
to shoot their red arrows beneath the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians get shot down if they go nearer fort,&rdquo; returned
the chief, with a shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;Let white chief
send <i>his</i> men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Neill bit his lip with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who proposed this attack?&rdquo; he cried, with flashing eyes.
&ldquo;I brought my men hither at your request. They were not
to risk their lives. If your Indians are brave, they can fire
the fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splitlog turned away without another word, and a few
minutes later a number of fiery arrows were seen to ascend
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
almost from beneath the very palisades. Several remained in
the roof, and Colonel O&rsquo;Neill clapped his hands over the demon&rsquo;s
success.</p>
<p>Thus far during the battle not a shot had been fired from
the fort. The allies wondered at this silence; but they were
not cognizant of the thrilling scenes being enacted behind the
strong walls.</p>
<p>Lashed to a tree on the river&rsquo;s bank, and strongly guarded
by three white men and two Wyandots, Wolf-Cap saw the discharge
of the fiery missiles. Since his arrival among the allies
he had seen nothing of Royal Funk; but he knew that
that worthy had absented himself but temporarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the fort to-night,&rdquo; said one of the outlaws, turning
to Wolf-Cap, during the flight of the blazing shafts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you don&rsquo;t know who defends it,&rdquo; the trapper said,
quickly, and with pride. &ldquo;Yon walls protect the bravest
men in New Connecticut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Captain Strong&mdash;what do you think of <i>him</i>?&rdquo; asked
the outlaw, with a curious smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has completely deceived me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white guards exchanged significant glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about him, Belt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that he intends to betray a lot of women and
children to the tender mercies of the tomahawk. I&rsquo;ve seen
Mary Sawyer in your camp. I heard the three pistol-shots
on the hill. I have heard something about Strong&rsquo;s antecedents,
and, putting things together, I kin read the blackest
tale of treason on record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be in the fort, just now?&rdquo; taunted
Sam Cole, the Night-Hawk.</p>
<p>The trapper&rsquo;s eyes flashed; but he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about that notice you put on your door for us?
You said that no walls should protect you while you fought
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to adhere to that declaration,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you wouldn&rsquo;t creep into Fort Strong if we war to let
you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outlaws laughed derisively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a mind to try you,&rdquo; said Cole, drawing his knife and
glancing at his fellow-guards.</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap said nothing.</p>
<p>The place where they stood was thickly studded with young
trees and tall grass, the latter much soiled by human feet. A
fire some distance down the river threw a weird light over
the scene; but toward the fort, in its river front, the depth
of darkness prevailed.</p>
<p>The Indian guards gazed at the outlaw with an immobility
of countenance, and when he stepped toward the trapper with
uplifted knife, they did not interpose a hand. They had
lately taken their stations as Wolf Cap&rsquo;s guards, and had
watched the helpless man with vigilant eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I&rsquo;ve a mind to try you, Wolf-Cap,&rdquo; reiterated the
outlaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t do, Sam,&rdquo; suddenly cried another, springing
forward and laying his brawny hand on Cole&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll escape if you cut his cords. What do a squatter&rsquo;s
words amount to? Let him be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Cole glared fiercely upon the speaker, and
then sullenly dropped the knife again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that Card Belt is a man of his word,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And I want to try &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the last word the outlaw shook the hand from his
shoulder, and stepped toward the trapper again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knife of the last speaker suddenly leaped from its
leathern sheath, and he advanced upon Cole, who turned and
pushed him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand off, Duke White,&rdquo; were Cole&rsquo;s menacing words.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a difficulty with you. I know what I&rsquo;m doing.
I&rsquo;ll try Wolf-Cap if I wish to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not!&rdquo; and White tried to step between Cole
and the captive.</p>
<p>But, with a fierce oath, Cole hurled Duke from the tree.
Duke recovered in a moment, and with all the baser passions
of his soul fully aroused, he sprung at his Titan comrade.</p>
<p>Cole saw the movement, and received the attack with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
knife, for it was apparent that the blood of a Night-Hawk
had to be shed by a brother&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>I say that Cole met the attack with the knife, and blood
flowed from the wound inflicted in Duke White&rsquo;s breast by
the shining steel. The next moment they had grappled, and
swayed to and fro in the struggle of life and death like contending
giants.</p>
<p>The third white guard started forward to strike Cole with
clubbed rifle, when one of the Indians, with a quick glance
at his companion, leaped toward the tree.</p>
<p>A knife flashed in the brave&rsquo;s hands, and when it descended
Wolf-Cap sprung from the sycamore&mdash;free! He saw the
second savage hurl the third guard into the murky waves of
the Huron, and glanced at the struggling Night-Hawks, now
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf-Cap run down the river,&rdquo; said the trapper&rsquo;s deliverer,
quickly pointing down the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I go to the fort, Silver Hand. Seek the black cave.
I&rsquo;ll meet you there at dawn. Quick! They come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke in the Wyandot tongue, and the next instant
bounded toward the fort. He glided rapidly through the
gloom, avoiding the numerous stumps, and yells on the river-bank
told him that the deed just enacted there had been discovered.</p>
<p>But he ran on, unarmed, save with a knife, which Silver
Hand had thrust into his grip, and he struck the ponderous
gate of the palisade twice with the bony hilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard! guard!&rdquo; he shouted, and then he heard the sentry
speak to some one beyond the pickets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! I know that voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis me&mdash;Wolf-Cap,&rdquo; called the trapper quickly upon the
guard&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get in. Captain Strong is a
traitor; he has promised to betray you into the hands of the
Indians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment of silence followed. The trapper had paused
for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your roof is on fire. Put it out, and see to the traitor.
Hold out like men. You&rsquo;ll get help from outside by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Wolf-Cap turned from the gate and started toward
the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The darkness favored his flight. As yet no attack had
been made upon the fort from the stream. The major portion
of the besiegers were on the hill, the summit of which
was on a level with the embrasures, into which the foe could
shoot with effect.</p>
<p>Thus far the enemy had trusted to the blazing arrows; but,
as the trapper gained the stream, a volley was poured into
the block-house.</p>
<p>The next moment it was returned by the besieged, and numerous
cries told Wolf-Cap that some of the foe had fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave the boys,&rdquo; said the trapper, sadly,
pausing in his flight, and listening to the battle which had
now opened furiously. &ldquo;And Huldah is yonder in the midst
of it all. But the Indians wait for me at the cave. Three
can do more than one. I wish the two war here now;
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the quick, sharp snapping of a twig, and Silver
Hand and his assistant stood before the trapper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We no go to cave,&rdquo; said Silver Hand. &ldquo;Hide here &rsquo;while
to watch fight. But look, Wolf-Cap! roof all on fire. Why
don&rsquo;t pale-faces put it out? They got water in fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the traitor has disabled them somehow. I&rsquo;m
afraid it&rsquo;s all day with the brave fellows. But they shan&rsquo;t
die alone!&rdquo; and the trapper started forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Hand and Golden Cheek go with Wolf-Cap,&rdquo; said
the Wyandot, and a moment later the trio were hurrying toward
the seemingly doomed structure.</p>
<p>That side of the roof which looked to the hill was in a furious
blaze, which threw a lurid glare upon the battle-ground,
and the discharges of musketry by both parties resembled a
pitched battle.</p>
<p>Suddenly the artillery of heaven added its thunder to the
fight, and great drops of rain began to fall thick and fast from
the inky clouds.</p>
<p>But let us return to the fort, and see what followed Levi
Armstrong&rsquo;s discovery of the poisoning of the well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />THE WORK OF A LIE.</h2>
<p>The settler&rsquo;s eyes fell upon Zebulon Strong, as the startling
words written at the conclusion of chapter five rung from his
lips.</p>
<p>But the captain stood the scrutiny unflinchingly, and started
forward with drawn sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traitor shall die!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let every one look to
his neighbor, and watch him closely. As for myself, I believe
that Morg Sawyer is the villain; but he is beyond our power.
Men, to the lower floor with picks; we&rsquo;ll dig another well
immediately. By the help of God, we&rsquo;ll hold out against the
red and white fiends until fresh water can be struck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away as he finished, and was ordering a number
of men below to inaugurate the digging of a new well, when
Huldah Armstrong bounded toward the settler and touched
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, in a cautious tone, &ldquo;Captain Strong is
the traitor! I was standing near the logs, a moment since,
and heard Wolf-Cap at the gate. He told the guards that our
captain had betrayed us into the hands of the savages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant Levi jerked his arm from Huldah&rsquo;s grip,
and started toward Strong, who was handing buckets of water
to the men on the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men,&rdquo; he cried, in thunderous tones, &ldquo;treason must not
thrive here. Captain Strong, you must consider yourself the
prisoner of the garrison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before turning to the old settler the traitor passed the
bucket he was in the act of lifting to the nearest man.</p>
<p>He retained a wonderful self composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I submit, if it be the will of the men,&rdquo; he said, calmly.
&ldquo;Heaven forefend that I should seek to betray these women
and children into merciless hands,&rdquo; and he glanced around on
the swarthy faces revealed by the tallow dips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let the captain help us,&rdquo; cried several voices; but old Levi
silenced the speakers with a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, but it won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The evidence is
strong against him. I saw him whispering to Morg Sawyer
at the gate, a minute before that dog&rsquo;s desertion, and Wolf-Cap
has just shouted over the palisades that he is a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time the captain&rsquo;s face grew pale, and Levi
proceeded to disarm him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for all this, Cap,&rdquo; he said, sympathetically; &ldquo;but
you see, we&rsquo;ve got to do it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest Captain Strong!&rdquo; interrupted a sturdy young settler,
whose head shot above the hatchway at this juncture.
&ldquo;Wolf-Cap has just halloed over the gate that he is a traitor.
Ah! so you&rsquo;ve already caught the dog! Zeb Strong, for a
shilling I&rsquo;d strike you stiff and cold on these boards. I&rsquo;ve
two sisters here, and to think that you would give them over
to the tomahawk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth towered before the suspected man with flashing
eyes and leveled gun, and other weapons were drawn to shed
the captain&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, boys; he&rsquo;s not condemned yet,&rdquo; said Levi Armstrong,
pushing the weapons aside. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tend to him after
the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we may not win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, of course, he dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A guard of several men was placed over the captain, who
was taken below where strong arms threw up the earth in
great heaps. Mad eyes fell upon the captive, and he was told
that his life would be forfeited if he attempted to escape.</p>
<p>Above, the settlers fought the flames at the risk of their
lives, for the foe were raining bullets from the hill and the
battle had opened in terrible earnest.</p>
<p>Suddenly a startling cry came from the vicinity of the
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the words were echoed on every side. Mothers
pressed their babes to their breasts, and told the little ones
that the last drop of water had been drawn from the
well!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;What of the fire?&rdquo; shouted Armstrong to the men on the
roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had more water we could master it,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;Without water we are doomed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he leaped to the gangway and cried to the well-diggers
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No water yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the despairing answer.</p>
<p>The fire-fighters threw the buckets from the roof and clambered
down after them. But all who went up did not come
down. Several had been shot by the enemy, and lay dead
on the ground between the fort and the palisades.</p>
<p>Now every one believed that the fort was doomed to destruction.
The clapboards on the western roof were blazing
furiously, and cinders were falling among the besieged. The
light added to the ghastly scene; but the settlers stood nobly
at the port-holes and more than one shot proved the death-knell
of a foe.</p>
<p>All at once a peal of thunder, rattling over their heads,
shook the fort to its very foundation, and ejaculations of joy
burst from every throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be praised!&rdquo; cried a woman bursting from the shuddering
throng with her babe in her arms. &ldquo;He is sending
the rain to save us. Praised be His holy name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later and the storm clouds broke and great gray
drops fell splattering in the fire.</p>
<p>The rain was greeted with a hearty cheer that reached the
ears of the besiegers, and every faint heart took hope. For
a moment the rain descended in scattered quantities, and then
it came down in gigantic and irresistible sheets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are saved&mdash;hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo; cried the younger settlers,
stepping back from the ports and slipping in the blood
and water that covered the puncheons. &ldquo;Open the well and
let the water in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, the crimson demon was yielding to the deluge,
and every one saw in their deliverance the hand of
Deity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not out of the fire yet,&rdquo; said Levi Armstrong, calmly,
for to him command of the fort had been given by unanimous
consent. &ldquo;After the rain we must fight again, then no
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
roof can protect us&mdash;the fire-arrows will drop among us.
But we must to work. Remove the ammunition below to a
dry place, and let our dead be laid aside and the wounded
cared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brave men sprung with eagerness to the task. Several
kegs of powder were carried below, and the loss of the garrison
looked after.</p>
<p>It was discovered that it had suffered quite severely during
the battle. From behind stumps, the Indians had fired into
the ports, distinctly revealed by the widely-leaping flames of
the roof, and with fatal effect. The majority of the stricken
settlers were killed outright&mdash;shot through the head&mdash;while
every wound was dangerous. Twenty-one men had fallen,
including the loss at the gate and another, Morgan Sawyer,
had deserted.</p>
<p>The well-diggers struck water as the storm broke over
the fort; but they did not cease their labors, for they knew
that it would not last long&mdash;a summer shower, but a furious,
a saving one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Armstrong, can I trust you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first speaker was Matt Hunter, the man whom Captain
Strong had placed over the well after Sawyer&rsquo;s defection.</p>
<p>He was a small, wiry man, rather prepossessing in appearance,
and had fought like a tiger with the water buckets.</p>
<p>Huldah Armstrong drew from his look that he had something
in view for the good of the garrison, and followed him
to the gangway.</p>
<p>But, as the settler had put his foot on the first round of
the ladder, the face of a strange man was revealed below, and
he started back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf-Cap!&rdquo; he shouted to the busy men and women about
him. &ldquo;Wolf-Cap is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately the cry of &ldquo;Wolf-Cap&rdquo; resounded throughout
the fort, and the next minute the Night-Hawks&rsquo; foe appeared
above the hatch!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, welcome, neighbor Belt!&rdquo; cried old Levi,
springing to the trapper. &ldquo;Bloody times, these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap, quickly. &ldquo;But to the ports;
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
This is the darkest hour of the night. The foe is crawling
through the storm both from the river and hill. Thank
heaven! the rain has saved your fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The settlers sprung to their places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The demons carry ladders,&rdquo; continued Wolf-Cap, &ldquo;and
they&rsquo;ll make a desperate effort to carry the palisades by
storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt Hunter and Huldah did not wait to hear the trapper&rsquo;s
words, but hurried below and paused before the guard at the
lower door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get out here,&rdquo; said the sentry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; echoed Hunter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on a mission from our
new captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Miss?&rdquo; asked the soldier, looking at Huldah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hunter should know,&rdquo; she answered, and the heavy
door was unbolted, and they stepped into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Armstrong, I am on a secret mission for your father,&rdquo;
he said, when they heard the door shut violently. &ldquo;I can
not disclose it yet, so please bear with me. We must now
relieve the gate guards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked rapidly toward the gate, where three sturdy
settlers stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jones, Vanderberg and Poston, I believe,&rdquo; he said, pausing
before the trio, whose forms were just visible in the
gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered a rough voice, &ldquo;them&rsquo;s we. What&rsquo;s
wanting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our new captain wants Vanderberg and Poston to the
council up-stairs. Wolf-Cap advocates a change of tactics.
We&mdash;Miss Armstrong and I&mdash;will guard the gate with Jones,
until relieved. We were sent hither for that duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt Hunter paused; but the two men hesitated. Since
the arrest of Zebulon Strong, they did not know whom to
trust, and theirs was the most important post connected with
the safety of the fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt other strength will be sent hither on your appearance
above,&rdquo; said Hunter, uneasily. &ldquo;Your voices are
needed in the council. You can leave your muskets here;
but I think we will not need &rsquo;em. Wolf-Cap reports the foe
under cover.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>His last words decided the guards; they leaned their muskets
against the stockade and left the gate.</p>
<p>Without difficulty they gained the interior of the fort, and
paused a moment to inquire into the progress of the well-diggers.</p>
<p>Then they ascended the ladder and appeared in the battle-room.
The storm had spent its fury by this time, but the
wind was flaring the dips and imparting a demi-gloom to the
entire interior of the place. Still, the light enabled the sentries
to see men at the port-holes, and the women were scrubbing
the floor with bedding. There was nothing that looked
like a council of war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo; asked Vanderberg, touching a woman&rsquo;s
arm&mdash;and the dame could not repress a cry when she
looked up into his white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; called a lusty voice from a darkened corner, and
a tall form advanced toward the guard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here&mdash;what&rsquo;s
wanting?&rdquo; and then the commander caught sight of Vanderberg&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Roger Vanderberg, what are <i>you</i> doing <i>here</i>?&rdquo;
he cried, and his hand closed on the settler&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Your
post is at the outer gate. What can have brought you hither?
Speak! These are nights when traitors are abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard, now thoroughly alarmed and frightened, could
not find his tongue for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Poston, you here too? Who <i>is</i> at the gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, your daughter and Matt Hunter,&rdquo; cried Vanderberg,
with considerable fire in his tone. &ldquo;He sent me up to the
council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Council? there&rsquo;s no council here,&rdquo; and the old settler&rsquo;s
cheeks suddenly grew pale. &ldquo;I never sent for you&mdash;never!
Matt Hunter must mean something terrible. We&rsquo;ll go down
and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprung to the hatch, and quickly disappeared, followed
by the sentries.</p>
<p>The lower guard opened the door without a challenge, and
the trio passed into the yard.</p>
<p>There Levi Armstrong&rsquo;s worst fears were realized. The
gate was deserted and stood ajar!</p>
<p>Deserted? No! At the foot of one of the posts lay the
body of a man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! Huldah is gone!&rdquo; cried the settler, staggering
from the scene, for a moment completely unmanned.</p>
<p>For a moment only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gate! the gate!&rdquo; he cried, springing forward, but
Vanderberg and Poston had foreseen the danger.</p>
<p>Their strong arms closed the ponderous structure, as a hundred
arrows buried their flinty heads in the boards!</p>
<p>The gate was then barricaded in a jiffy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! They&rsquo;re about to storm us,&rdquo; said Vanderberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, then! Summon thirty men hither!&rdquo; shouted Levi.
&ldquo;We must meet them here first. &rsquo;Twill be daylight soon,
thank heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vanderberg sprung to execute the task assigned him, and
the old settler bent over the form lying at the gate.</p>
<p>It was poor Jones. His skull had been crushed by the butt
of a musket, and he was quite dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old fort swarms with traitors,&rdquo; said Armstrong, looking
up at Poston. &ldquo;Hunter was Strong&rsquo;s confederate. Now
we&rsquo;ll meet the storming dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He muttered the last sentence as a body of men emerged
from the fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huldah isn&rsquo;t gone, Armstrong?&rdquo; said the foremost man,
whose wolf-skin cap proclaimed his personality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone&mdash;gone, Belt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse the luck! Why didn&rsquo;t I shoot Matt Hunter, when
I caught him tampering with my traps, two years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would to heaven you had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap looked at the settler and then gritted his great
teeth till they fairly cracked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matt Hunter took the girl along to buy his own liberty,&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;Royal Funk will get her now. But he
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t wear her&mdash;no! not while my name is Card Belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor while mine is Mark Harmon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper started and saw the young borderman standing
by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hand on that, boy!&rdquo; cried the trapper, with a smile,
and two hands were clasped and sealed in determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the dogs have gone back to growl,&rdquo; said Belt,
glancing up. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve let the golden moment slip. It&rsquo;s
gettin&rsquo; too light to attack now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />A BIT OF MUTINY.</h2>
<p>Fort Strong could not have successfully resisted an assault
of the allies on the stockade. The settlers knew this;
but were determined that the foe should be met with courage
as fierce as his own, and that he should find none but dead
bodies when he entered the fort.</p>
<p>Already the women were arming themselves and their words
of encouragement threw more strength into their husbands&rsquo;
arms.</p>
<p>We left Wolf-Cap and the two Indian chiefs hurrying toward
the fort, and have also witnessed the former&rsquo;s appearance
among the besieged. Before entering, he had tarried a
while without for the purpose of watching the enemy. His
great heart leaped for joy when the rain began to descend,
and beside the gate, he dismissed the chiefs with low words,
intended for their ears alone.</p>
<p>He heard the foe approach, and learned that they bore ladders
which, no doubt, they had constructed beyond the hill
during the day, and then he hastened to prepare the settlers
for the new danger.</p>
<p>But the sky grew lighter, and the assault came not. From
some cause which the besieged could not fathom, the proposed
attack had been suddenly abandoned, and when the light rendered
objects distinguishable from the fort, not an enemy
could be seen.</p>
<p>The dun storm clouds rolled heavily toward the south, and
by-and-by the sun&rsquo;s rays fell upon the charred roof of Fort
Strong.</p>
<p>But let us follow the fortunes of Huldah Armstrong, and
learn why the assault was abandoned&mdash;abandoned when the
most unlearned warrior could foresee the result of a grand attack
with the ladders.</p>
<p>To all appearances, the Indians had been withdrawn from
the river; but such was not the case. The light of the burning
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
roof revealed the ground between fort and stream, but not
a brave lay behind the stumps. Colonel O&rsquo;Neill attacked the
fort from the hill only, thinking that the garrison might be
driven to an attempt to fly to the river and escape by boats.
Therefore, he had drawn the Indians to the tall grass on the
bank, and during the entire fight not a shot was fired from
the ambush.</p>
<p>But the colonel&rsquo;s plans did not succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this delay?&rdquo; exclaimed the officer, angrily, looking
and listening from the summit of the hill where he stood, surrounded
by half a dozen Indians and as many English officers.
&ldquo;The assault should have been made ere this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not heard Funk&rsquo;s signal yet, colonel,&rdquo; answered
one of the officers, suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire and fury! he should have given it five minutes since,&rdquo;
and O&rsquo;Neill looked at a beautiful chronometer which he drew
from his bosom. &ldquo;The truth of the matter is, Funk is crazy
after a girl in the fort, and if he can get her, he will let the
foe beat us off. Curse the laggard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A minute&rsquo;s silence followed the Briton&rsquo;s last words. The
signal, whatever it was to have been, did not cleave the cool
night air&mdash;not a sound came from the fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jig is up,&rdquo; hoarsely hissed O&rsquo;Neill, stamping his foot
with rage. &ldquo;Funk&rsquo;s infernal passion for that girl has ruined
our plans. Splitlog, is he a specimen of the men you associate
with? Go and recall the forces! The day is breaking
now, and if our men are not instantly withdrawn, they will
be slaughtered like sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wyandot sachem left the hill, and presently every besieger
relinquished the designed attack.</p>
<p>Colonel O&rsquo;Neill was livid with rage, and threatened to
withdraw his troops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank is the cause of all this,&rdquo; he thundered to Splitlog.
&ldquo;You should take the villain out and shoot him when he
shows his face in camp. But he&rsquo;ll never have the audacity to
show his face here. Perhaps he succeeded in getting the
girl, and has fled to parts unknown. The fort would have
been ours after a brief struggle. The deserter declares that
Strong has six men on whom he can depend. So, chief, you
see what we have missed by one man&rsquo;s absorbing passion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Night-Hawk do bad work, sure,&rdquo; said Splitlog, like the
colonel, in no good humor. &ldquo;He better not come back to
braves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killing him won&rsquo;t mend matters; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interruption that broke the sentence was caused by
the sudden appearance of a young Wyandot warrior, who informed
the twain that Royal Funk and his Night-Hawks
were boldly approaching.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Neill and the chief exchanged looks of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man possesses the audacity of the devil,&rdquo; said the
colonel. &ldquo;Now stick to your word, Splitlog; pay him up.
Do not listen to his excuses. If you do, he&rsquo;ll conquer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>White and red occupied the tent of the former, and when
they stepped out, they beheld a large body of soldiers and
savages approaching.</p>
<p>At the head of the array walked Roy Funk and his remaining
Night-Hawks, six in number, for Sam Cole had slain his
white adversary at the tree to which Wolf-Cap was bound at
the opening of the fort fight, and the second Night-Hawk
whom Silver Hand threw into the river on the same occasion,
would march no more to deeds of brigandage.</p>
<p>There was a cloud on the outlaw&rsquo;s face as he neared the
little group; but he walked boldly erect, unmindful of the
fierce looks and muttered epithets that the Indians hurled
upon him.</p>
<p>At length he halted before the couple at the tent, and
looked them calmly in the eye without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come to report,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill, suddenly and sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your permission, sir,&rdquo; retorted the Night-Hawk
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish, you may tell the story of your treachery.
Though I would rather not hear it, I will listen. You know
the disaster you have hurled upon this army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, to some extent, perhaps, to blame for the non-attack
on the stockade. I am willing to take all the blame on
my shoulders at any rate. They are strong,&rdquo; and he shrugged
them, &ldquo;and can carry heavy loads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let the Night-Hawk talk of his dog acts,&rdquo; cried Splitlog,
stepping nearer Funk, furious almost beyond control.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was about ready to give my signal when we beheld
a suspicious figure creeping from the fort to the river.
We followed, and captured a man&mdash;Matt Hunter by name.
He was a deserter and told us much. Captain Strong is a
prisoner in the fort. His designs have been discovered.
Wolf-Cap is in the fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you held him captive?&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill, at this
juncture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, but Cole wanted to trust his honesty, and Duke
White here interfered. They fought and Cole got the best
of Duke; but, after all, Wolf-Cap escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the man you caught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys gave him to the Wyandots by the river. He&rsquo;s
yonder now with Sawyer, the other deserter. He was carrying
a woman from the fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stealing a woman, eh? Go on, Roy Funk, this is a romantic
story you&rsquo;re telling. Took some hard thinking no
doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An illy-concealed sneer pervaded the officer&rsquo;s words; but
the outlaw chief did not appear to notice it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got the girl of course, and,&rdquo; looking at O&rsquo;Neill, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
my girl, colonel&mdash;Huldah Armstrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will all do to tell, Roy Funk,&rdquo; said the soldier; &ldquo;but
it won&rsquo;t slip down. You don&rsquo;t understand greasing lies.
That is an art which you should have mastered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll believe me if I produce the deserter and girl?&rdquo;
flashed Funk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, and not until then will I credit a single word you
have uttered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outlaw turned quickly upon one of his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson, go and bring Hunter and the girl here,&rdquo; he
said, in maddened tones, and the look which he then darted
at his other Night-Hawks drew them nearer his imperiled
form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see that I haven&rsquo;t lied!&rdquo; he said, turning to
O&rsquo;Neill again. &ldquo;Splitlog has enjoyed a long acquaintance
with me, and he can not put his finger on a single lie of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what say you in extenuation of your crime of disobeying
orders?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Circumstances, sir, interposed to check my career, and
when I had disposed of my captives, you were withdrawing
your troops. But, Colonel O&rsquo;Neill, I want you to understand
that I am a free man here. Roy Funk and his fellows do as
they please; but for this time I have condescended to be a
subordinate. You, sir, are the minority here. Splitlog by
superiority of numbers commands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Neill bit his lip and referred the outlaw to the Wyandot
for punishment. He felt that Splitlog would rid himself of
Funk&rsquo;s presence, and now he devoutly wished the forest freebooter
out of his way.</p>
<p>A brief time elapsed between Jackson&rsquo;s disappearance and
his return.</p>
<p>A line of knolls or hills encircled the southern side of the
fort, and terminated at the river. They enabled the outlaw
to perform his errand without being seen by the besieged
settlers, and he approached the assemblage with Huldah Armstrong
and the treacherous borderman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Funk, in triumph, looking at his prisoners.
&ldquo;Colonel O&rsquo;Neill, have I lied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The British soldier did not reply, for he was looking at
the settler&rsquo;s daughter, whose wonderful backwoods beauty was
entrancing his Highland-tainted heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Night-Hawk want to do with white girl?&rdquo;
asked Splitlog, breaking the silence that followed Funk&rsquo;s
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend making her Mrs. Funk, as I have told the colonel,&rdquo;
said the outlaw, quickly, glancing at the officer as he
spoke. &ldquo;She is mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Night-Hawk didn&rsquo;t give signal. He let a squaw run
off with his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splitlog&rsquo;s anger was rising again, and O&rsquo;Neill was secretly
rejoicing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, chief; but to-night we&rsquo;ll work together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like we did when it was dark before,&rdquo; hissed the Wyandot,
and his right arm started back threateningly. &ldquo;The
Night-Hawk is a traitor, and traitors are dogs. He no man
at all who&rsquo;ll let blue eyes draw him from duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is Splitlog going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The question was put calmly, but there was the lurking of
a defiant, devil-may-care spirit in the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He going to make example, as the pale-faces say,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;Little Hickory, take the girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; interrupted the outlaw, and before the
chief addressed could advance a step, Jackson threw Huldah
Armstrong forward and Funk caught her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appeal to the braves of the Wyandot nation, and to true
English soldiers,&rdquo; he cried, springing upon a fallen tree and
looking around over the crowd. &ldquo;I have fought for the flag
of St. George and for the wampum of the Wyandots. I failed
in a duty last night, but to-night we can take the fort. Put
yourselves in my place last night. For such a pretty woman
as this, who would not have forgotten every thing save love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Numerous cheers greeted the outlaw&rsquo;s speech, but Splitlog,
with a cloud on his face, advanced toward the log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, chief,&rdquo; cried Funk, cocking one of his pistols, and
looking down upon the Wyandot. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to shed
blood on this occasion. My men will stand by me&mdash;if we go
down, &rsquo;twill be as the fall of one man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stern determination was written on the Night-Hawk&rsquo;s face,
and he glanced at Huldah, hanging half-senseless across his
left arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give in to him!&rdquo; whispered O&rsquo;Neill to Splitlog,
who had stopped. &ldquo;Make an example of the dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief was inclined to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vote! a vote!&rdquo; cried the soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have no votes on this question!&rdquo; thundered Colonel
O&rsquo;Neill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; answered a stalwart corporal, stepping forward,
pistol in hand. &ldquo;Colonel O&rsquo;Neill, your men say that Funk&rsquo;s
fate shall not be settled by one man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire and furies, this is mutiny!&rdquo; and the English sword
leaped from its scabbard. &ldquo;Corporal, who commands the
Ninety-first&mdash;you or I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Quitman did not reply, but saluted his superior
and stepped aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will vote on Funk&rsquo;s life!&rdquo; came a cry from the rebellious
quarter, and the Indians began to demand a ballot, in
their own language.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Colonel O&rsquo;Neill was shaking with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel, you had best listen to the men!&rdquo; ventured Quitman,
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave you authority to suggest to me?&rdquo; roared the
epauleted Briton, starting toward the corporal. &ldquo;Sergeant
Wilkinson, arrest the mutineer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the sergeant did not stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! dare you disobey, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare!&rdquo; was the quiet response. &ldquo;Colonel, if a majority
of the Wyandots and the old Ninety-first say that Funk&rsquo;s deed
deserves death, we will submit. But one man, and he an <i>Indian</i>,
shall not dictate in such a case as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mutineers applauded the sergeant&rsquo;s words, and Colonel
O&rsquo;Neill stepped back, and gazed with horror into Splitlog&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you want, colonel,&rdquo; said Roy Funk, at this
juncture, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t blame you, either, for you don&rsquo;t pick
up such a girl as this in the woods every day. Let the red-coats
vote, and the Indians, too. If they say I deserve death,
you may kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Neill looked up at the outlaw, and then turned to the
sachem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave it to you, Splitlog,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Count me out;
but Funk should live if he can cower such a man as you!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />SENT INTO EXILE.</h2>
<p>Splitlog shrugged his shoulders and turned to his braves.</p>
<p>The lives of many brave men hung upon his savage caprices,
and the silence that followed O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s last and bitter
words seemed palpable.</p>
<p>The Wyandot hated, detested the British, Colonel O&rsquo;Neill
particularly; but he had sold his nation to the English cause,
and he must not, in a single act, manifest an abatement of
zeal. The colonel, under whose command Splitlog had already
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
fought, had said that Royal Funk&rsquo;s disobedience should
be punished with death, and the Indian believed that he spoke
to the king.</p>
<p>But the British soldiers were demanding something of a
trial for the outlaw, and his Indians were joining in the clamor.
So far as he was personally concerned, he would not
punish Funk, and here was an opportunity to favor the forest
freebooter. Funk, no doubt, had done Splitlog a service in
days gone by, and an Indian never forgets such an action.</p>
<p>He stood before the outlaw a moment in silence, and then
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splitlog hears the voices of his people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
will not strike the Night-Hawk until they have pronounced
on his fate. He,&rdquo; pointing to Funk, &ldquo;has lived long among
the Wyandots; they know him&mdash;he is brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Indian paused, O&rsquo;Neill stepped forward, and laid
his hand on the naked shoulder. The Briton&rsquo;s face was still
aflame with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say nothing for nor against him, chief,&rdquo; he said, in the
Wyandot tongue. &ldquo;Tell your braves to say life or death,
and that quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snapped the words out fiercely, and darted a malignant
look at Splitlog as he turned away:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you for this, you scarlet dog,&rdquo; he murmured, under
his breath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you for lying, see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splitlog smiled contemptuously, and bit his nether lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with you, Wyandots,&rdquo; he cried, angrily, flashing
his eyes over his armed nation. &ldquo;Down like wolves, and let
the warriors who vote for life hold up their guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like one man the red assembly dropped to the ground,
and near two hundred guns were held on high!</p>
<p>A majority voted for life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew they&rsquo;d do it,&rdquo; hissed O&rsquo;Neill. &ldquo;And Splitlog
sanctions the decision. My men shall not vote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stern determination clothed the last words, and they
were yet quivering on his lips when the chief, with a triumph
which his best dissimulative arts could not conceal, turned
upon him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let the red-coats vote,&rdquo; cried Splitlog. &ldquo;If many
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
of them say &lsquo;death,&rsquo; the waters of the Huron shall roll over
the Night-Hawk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An eager gleam of hope lit up the colonel&rsquo;s eyes at this.</p>
<p>Sword in hand he leaped upon the log near the Night-Hawk
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You who vote for life will advance ten paces westward.
Right about&mdash;face. Forward&mdash;march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many a Briton obeyed the military command, and the colonel
ordered a sergeant to count the ayes.</p>
<p>Two hundred and one men voted for life, and strange to
say, <i>a like number had kept their places</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vote for death!&rdquo; said the colonel, when he had informed
Splitlog of the even counts; &ldquo;therefore I make a majority,
and the outlaw dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Splitlog vote?&rdquo; cried the chief. &ldquo;No! he left it to
his men. But he will look to the vote of the red-coats. He
says that the Night-Hawk shall fly from the land of the Wyandots
before the sun sweeps over the bosom of the Huron
again, and he shall never return. Does this suit the king&rsquo;s
soldier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should die. We, his own people, say as much,&rdquo; said
O&rsquo;Neill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Indians say, &lsquo;Live, Night-Hawk.&rsquo; Splitlog must listen
to his people; when they say &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he must not say
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it, then. But he shall not take his captive along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is his he may keep,&rdquo; answered the Indian, and
then he looked up at Royal Funk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night-Hawk, you are free to go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After this
night, let these forests hear your tread no more. Splitlog
and his braves say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; answered Funk. &ldquo;I accept your mercy. I go,
never to return. Soldiers who voted for my life, I thank
you; and, Colonel O&rsquo;Neill, my fervent prayer is that we may
meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; grated the Briton. &ldquo;I echo your prayer from
the bottom of my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, boys,&rdquo; said the outlaw, descending from his perch,
and addressing his band in a low tone, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll leave this accursed
place at once, or so soon as we can get off. We&rsquo;ll go
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
down the river in barges, and after a while strike over land
toward Detroit. There&rsquo;s no use in talking. Our days are
up in the &lsquo;fire-lands,&rsquo; though I&rsquo;d like to linger here to settle
scores with Wolf-Cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Night-Hawks expressed their willingness to follow
their leader, but they abominated the thought of a forced exile.
They had lorded it over the fire-lands until they believed
themselves invincible, but they had discovered one at whose
command they must depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Huldah, we are going to leave the old fire-lands,
and we&rsquo;re never coming back any more. What do you
think about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the settler&rsquo;s child said nothing. She stood
before the outlaw in the little tent which Colonel O&rsquo;Neill had
given him, when they were on better terms than now, and
looked up into his darkly handsome face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, sir, I do not wish to go,&rdquo; were the words that
fell from her lips, at last. &ldquo;But I know &rsquo;tis useless for me to
appeal to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Utterly useless, Huldah,&rdquo; he answered, calmly. &ldquo;I will
offer you no violence, and none shall come to you from any
one. But let me tell you now that I am very passionate, and
that no hand shall snatch you from me. I will make no
avowal of love; this is not the place for such; but if I did
not love you I would return you to the old man who, in <i>your</i>
presence calls you child. Huldah, tell me how many lovers
you possess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, unless I must regard you as such,&rdquo; she answered,
with a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have thought a moment before you spoke.
There&rsquo;s Wolf-Cap&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His hair is gray in many places,&rdquo; said Huldah, interrupting
him. &ldquo;He is not my lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted; but hasn&rsquo;t some young hunter in Fort Strong
looked softly into your eyes? Speak truly, Huldah Armstrong&mdash;I
want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the settler&rsquo;s daughter recalled the daring
young men who had bravely defended their loved ones in the
besieged fort, and a flush of crimson mantled her fair
cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have no lover,&rdquo; she said, looking up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you blushed while you thought,&rdquo; said the outlaw,
quickly; &ldquo;and blushes, like figures, Huldah, do not lie. Some
young buck-skin-clad fellow has made your heart beat fast behind
the walls of the doomed fort. Tell me his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would kill him, if he escaped the massacre. Huldah, I
will endure no rivals for your hand. Remember this. But
you have skipped a lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fair girl, whose cheeks had grown pale beneath the
vengeful words, looked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you possess a third lover, Huldah. Can you not
name him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not. Your words are fraught with mystery,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel O&rsquo;Neill is your lover. He tried to have me shot,
that he might possess you. What do you think of your red-coated
Adonis? He&rsquo;s the handsomest of all your lovers&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
he, Huldah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outlaw laughed at his sarcastic question, and turned
to talk to one of his men, whose face appeared at the opening.</p>
<p>A short conversation in a low whisper passed between the
Night-Hawks, when the face disappeared, and Funk turned to
his captive again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t get off till near sundown,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That
liveried dog has refused to loan us his boats, and Splitlog has
been compelled to send to the mouth of the Catauga for several
of his own. By heavens! Huldah, I want to meet that
man away from his men. I&rsquo;d promote Major Gosnoke to the
colonelcy with a bullet. There&rsquo;s something devilish afoot. I
feel it. This night will witness treacherous deeds. O&rsquo;Neill
will not give you up tamely&mdash;neither will I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the outlaw walked from the tent, and Huldah
Armstrong heard him say a few words to the Night-Hawks
who guarded her, before he walked away.</p>
<p>The long hours of that summer day waned, and not a shot
was fired at the fort. It was a painful silence to the girl, and
told of bloody scenes during the coming darkness. She could
see the charred roof from her prison, but not a besieged form
greeted her eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>By and by the trees on the river-bank cast long shadows,
and Splitlog, followed by numerous warriors and a few soldiers,
was seen approaching the outlaw&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p>Five Night-Hawks received the company with lowering
gaze, and a word from the chief drew out Roy Funk and his
prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready, chief,&rdquo; said the Night-Hawk leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then to the river,&rdquo; replied Splitlog, pointing to the water.
&ldquo;The boats wait for the Night-Hawks of the fire-lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire party marched down to the river, where an outlaw
and several Indians guarded two large and strong boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the beginning of our journey, Huldah,&rdquo; said Roy
Funk, as he gently lifted the settler&rsquo;s daughter into one of the
barks. &ldquo;The beginning, I say; God knows what the ending
will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words implied grave doubts of a safe termination of the
voyage; but the next moment he was talking cheerfully to his
men and the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you again, Splitlog,&rdquo; called the outlaw, as the
boats were cast from their moorings. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drink fire-water
some day over our doings in the fire-lands. But remember
what I whispered in your ear: watch him, as you would
a snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the outlaws seized the pliant paddles, and the two big
boats moved rapidly down the current.</p>
<p>For the dusk that stretched before the voyagers seemed
to breathe of a lurking foe.</p>
<p>Splitlog and his companions watched the boats until a bend
in the river hid them from sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the chief, turning away, &ldquo;the white man&rsquo;s
fort falls. The night is coming on, and the flames of the
big timbers must light the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But other scenes than the taking of the block-house, were
to demand the Wyandot&rsquo;s attention before dawn.</p>

<br />BAFFLED IN AMBUSH.</h2>
<p>An hour after the departure of the exiles, night spread her
pall over the earth, and two men scaled the stockade of Fort
Strong and glided toward the hill lately tenanted by the
foe.</p>
<p>The spies&mdash;for spies the couple undoubtedly were&mdash;boasted
of white skins, and the moon, just rising and showering her
light through the trees beside the river, proclaimed them
Wolf-Cap and Mark Harmon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand this silence,&rdquo; remarked the old trapper
to his companion. &ldquo;Surely the demons hevn&rsquo;t given over the
attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they have quarreled among themselves,&rdquo; said
young Harmon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be. O&rsquo;Neill is a fidgety fellow, they say, and if
he gets spiteful at Splitlog, why he&rsquo;ll withdraw his support.
Why they didn&rsquo;t attack us last night when they could have
won, may ever remain a mystery. But silence now&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
reached the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some minutes the twain crouched at the foot of the
acclivity and listened, but heard nothing. Where was the foe?
Wolf-Cap was puzzled, and threw one of his queer enigmatical
looks into Harmon&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me! if I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve they&rsquo;ve vamosed,&rdquo; he whispered,
and then, bidding his comrade retain his position, he
proceeded to extend the reconnoissance to the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news for the fort, boy!&rdquo; he said, in tones of undisguised
joy. &ldquo;The varmints hev vamosed the diggin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! they haven&rsquo;t retreated with victory in their
grasp?&rdquo; exclaimed the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone, anyhow. The red dogs marched around
the hills to the river, and the Indians took a south-easterly
trail. This tells the story of a family quarrel. O&rsquo;Neill has
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
got his back up about suthin&rsquo; and so he cut loose from Splitlog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t the Indian remain and attack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted to show his choler, too. He wouldn&rsquo;t stay
for spite, but we&rsquo;ll hear from him in the Muskingum valley
afore long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go back and tell the good news,&rdquo; said Mark
Harmon, eagerly. &ldquo;Then we hunt for Huldah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we&rsquo;ll follow Splitlog until we find Funk, for the
outlaw will, of course, stick with the chief; they&rsquo;ve been old
cronies for years, and Funk isn&rsquo;t the man to trust himself
among a British regiment with a pretty woman. O&rsquo;Neill
might want Huldah, you see, and, backed by his men, Funk
wouldn&rsquo;t hev the ghost of a show as his rival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spies now set out on their return to the fort, and
Wolf-Cap rapped heavily on the gate with the butt of his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to fling &rsquo;er wide, boys,&rdquo; he cried, in a
loud tone. &ldquo;The devils hev got scared at their own shadow,
and the old fort is saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saved! saved! the foe has fled!&rdquo; shouted the guard, as
he opened the gate, and then cheer on cheer shook the old
structure to its staunch foundation logs.</p>
<p>Fathers dropped their weapons and embraced wives in the
transport of joy, and mothers kissed their children a hundred
times, and thanked God for deliverance with tearful
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going now, Mark, and I,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap to Levi
Armstrong, in the midst of the rejoicings, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re going
to fetch your girl back, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not go alone, Belt. I will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will stay right where you are!&rdquo; interrupted the hunter,
imperatively. &ldquo;You are needed here. Some band of
dusky fellows may attack the fort during my absence, and
these helpless women and children can not spare you. Did
I say that Mark and I war going alone? Yes. But we are
not. Silver Hand and Golden Cheek will join us somewhar
in the woods, and those two fellows kin outwit a thousand
Night-Hawks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armstrong reluctantly consented to remain in command of
the fort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;When will you return, Belt?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within five days, or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we keep Strong untried for five days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; put him on trial to-morrow. If he is proven a traitor,
deal with him accordingly. You can testify for me, for I
have told you all that I know bearing on the case. But we
must be off, Armstrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper put forth his hand, and with many good
wishes for the journey, Armstrong pressed it and saw the
twain pass out the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may never see him again,&rdquo; said the old settler, pausing
suddenly as the ponderous gate swung back. &ldquo;He ought to
know all now. I will tell him; it will make him more cautious,
and he will hate me, I know. Yes, I will disclose the
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly then, he turned to the gate again, and bade the
sentry open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see Wolf-Cap again,&rdquo; said Levi, and then he
stepped without.</p>
<p>The dusky forms of the two men were still visible toward
the river.</p>
<p>He hurried forward; but his heart failed him, for he suddenly
returned to the fort without hailing the trapper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t break the spell,&rdquo; he said, slowly and in an undertone,
shaking his head. &ldquo;I still hold the blessed belief into
which I have schooled my heart for many years. When
Wolf-Cap brings her back, I&rsquo;ll tell him all. God give her
back to me, for I love her. Though he kill me, I will tell
him all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the earnest prayer of a brave man, and he soon rejoined
the settlers, still happy over the unexpected deliverance.</p>
<p>But we must return to the British colonel.</p>
<p>At a certain point two miles below the bend in the river,
mentioned at the conclusion of the preceding chapter, several
large trees lay on the ground, hurled down by the fury
of some storm-demon. These trees furnished a natural ambush,
almost entirely impenetrable by the human eye, and
from their leafy coverts a company of soldiers could sweep
the stream either way, for a great distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The ambush was not untenanted when Roy Funk and his
companions left the Indians, and turned the prows of their canoes
toward Lake Erie.</p>
<p>The moon, as she scaled the horizon, looked down upon
scarlet uniforms beneath the leaves, and the night-winds
heard low voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel, do you think Gosnoke equal to the emergency?&rdquo;
asked a soldier, looking at the British colonel peeping through
the boughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. Ere this, he has obeyed orders, and peacefully
too, for we have heard no noise. Splitlog knows now, that
I am not to be trampled, and spit on with impunity. I
played the red-skin devil a British trick to-night, and he will
never forget it. But I&rsquo;m tired of waiting here. It is almost
time for Gosnoke&rsquo;s appearance, and here Funk and his accursed
hounds have not hove in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer never took his eyes from the shining surface of
the water, while he answered the private, and his nervous
actions proclaimed his impatience.</p>
<p>The reader can guess the motive that led the Briton to the
ambush. He intended to intercept the exiles, and finish the rivalry
that existed between himself and the Night-Hawk for
the face of Huldah Armstrong. He selected a dozen soldiers
whom he could trust, and while the outlaws were preparing
to depart, he led his men to the ambush.</p>
<p>Major Gosnoke was left at the hill to withdraw the British
forces from co-operation with Splitlog&rsquo;s warriors. He&mdash;the
colonel&mdash;dared not carry out his treachery in person, for the
Wyandot sachem was an impulsive savage, and he might pay
the penalty of his desertion with his life.</p>
<p>For many minutes after the brief conversation between the
colonel and his privates, a dead silence reigned over forest
and stream, but all at once this was broken by the voice of a
soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boats are coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel O&rsquo;Neill started and looked up the river. Two
black spots were visible on the shining water. Undoubtedly
the canoes belonged to the Night-Hawk&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, men?&rdquo; whispered O&rsquo;Neill, turning to his troops.
&ldquo;The devils are sailing right into our clutches. We want no
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
noise now. Murphy, you are to do the hailing&mdash;recollect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier nodded, and all eyes were fastened on the approaching
boats.</p>
<p>The muskets were at full cock, ready, if needed, to pour
a deadly fire into the barges.</p>
<p>Colonel O&rsquo;Neill held his breath and glanced anxiously
from the boats to Murphy, who, with the hailing words on
his lips, awaited his commands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the shadow now,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill, in reply to
a look from his soldier. &ldquo;When they emerge and execute
four more strokes, you may speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A group of trees threw a belt of shadow across the stream
a short distance above the ambush, and into this darkness the
two boats had glided.</p>
<p>All at once they drifted into the moonlight again, and the
studied words were on Murphy&rsquo;s tongue, when he suddenly
started back, and threw a look of amazement into the colonel&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>The boats were empty!</p>
<p>The men in the ambush exchanged looks of surprise, mingled
with superstition.</p>
<p>Colonel O&rsquo;Neill was so chagrined that he could not speak
for several moments.</p>
<p>He riveted his eyes upon the boats, reluctantly believing
the evidence of his senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Murphy, swim out and intercept the boats!&rdquo; he
suddenly roared. &ldquo;Hell and furies! we have been betrayed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murphy obeyed, and with the aid of several comrades
drew the barges ashore.</p>
<p>To the bottom of one canoe a piece of paper was pinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of my boats, colonel,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;I will take
care of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roy Funk&rsquo;s name was appended to the writing!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />TREASON IN THE CAMP.</h2>
<p>Colonel O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s face grew red and white by turns with
rage.</p>
<p>He looked at the writing until the letters swam before his
eyes.</p>
<p>His prey had escaped, and he swore roundly for several
minutes before a gentlemanly word passed his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murphy,&rdquo; he said, his anger slumbering but not appeased.
&ldquo;Murphy, you, with two men, will await the arrival
of the command at this point, and will proceed with it to
the destination communicated by me to Gosnoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, where does our colonel go?&rdquo; asked Murphy, who
ventured because he was on familiar terms with O&rsquo;Neill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after Funk. By heavens! that scoundrel shall
not escape me. He&rsquo;s abandoned the boats somewhere up the
river, and taken to the forest trails. But how did he know
that we were waiting here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that puzzles the b&rsquo;hoys, kurnel,&rdquo; said an Irish soldier.
&ldquo;Faith an&rsquo; they must hev smelt us, fur devil a noise
did we make among the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some dastardly red-skin has betrayed us, Teddy,&rdquo; said
O&rsquo;Neill, coloring again. &ldquo;Now, Murphy, mind what I have
told you. The trail they would take, I think, leads in a
north-westerly direction to the lake shore. It can be reached
by marching due west from this point; but I am not acquainted
with the forest hereabout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks, I can lead you to the trail,&rdquo; said a man who,
though clad in English uniform, was no soldier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
tramped these parts several times. By good marching,
we can reach the falls of Beaver river by eleven. There we
will strike the Detroit trail and discover something of Roy
Funk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Briton was pleased, and a few minutes later disappeared
with his men in the funereal recesses of the wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with the Indian. There&rsquo;s no use in running our
legs off after we have eluded the foe. It&rsquo;s a long way to
Detroit, and we might as well rest here as on the lake shore.
Boys, I apprehend no pursuit. Splitlog, of course, will not
follow, and O&rsquo;Neill will lead his regiment to the lakes when
it joins him on the river. The Indian counsels a rest till
morning. He has walked us fast, and Miss Armstrong is
greatly fatigued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words just written fell from Royal Funk&rsquo;s lips, several
hours after O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s disappointment in the ambush.</p>
<p>He stood on the bank of a narrow stream which, in those
days, bore the rather pretentious cognomen of Beaver <i>river</i>.
At this point a beautiful cascade added to the wild scenery,
and he faced his Night-Hawks, who had just halted from a
fatiguing march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we are willin&rsquo; to rest, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said one of the
men. &ldquo;That is, if you really think it best to do so, and of
course you would not talk as you hev if you did not. A rest
till daylight will do us no harm; but,&rdquo; and the speaker approached
Funk and glanced at a half-naked Indian leaning
against a tree, as he lowered his voice, &ldquo;but, cap&rsquo;n, do you
fully trust the Wyandot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I call him a traitor? Because he has just
saved our lives, Whalley? He&rsquo;s a genuine Wyandot; I&rsquo;ve
seen him a hundred times with Splitlog. But what have you
against &rsquo;im?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, cap&rsquo;n, nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; answered Whalley; &ldquo;only I
wanted to know if you thought him sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear for Spagano,&rdquo; said Funk. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a faithful
fellow. Remember, we would have rowed into O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s
muskets if it hadn&rsquo;t been for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian upon hearing his name pronounced left the tree
and came forward.</p>
<p>He was a tall, muscular fellow, naked to the waist, and
wore a crest of painted dove feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Night-Hawks want with Spagano?&rdquo; he asked, in
broken English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. But hold, chief. Where had we best camp
to-night&mdash;here or across the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; and, with a curious smile, the Indian described a
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
circle with his hand. &ldquo;We safe this side Beaver&mdash;not so safe,
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps, on other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preparations for a sojourn till day, on the bank of Beaver
river, were at once inaugurated by the party, and several of
the outlaws employed themselves in catching fish below the
falls.</p>
<p>Spagano, the Wyandot guide, lingered about the little
camp.</p>
<p>To him the outlaws owed their lives. It was in this manner:</p>
<p>Immediately after rounding the bend that shut the exiles
from Splitlog&rsquo;s sight, an Indian made his appearance on the
river-bank, and Funk was induced to take him in. He proved
to be the bearer of startling news, and declared that he was
acting in accordance with the wishes of the Wyandot sachem&mdash;Splitlog.</p>
<p>Colonel O&rsquo;Neill and two hundred soldiers (the Indian&rsquo;s exaggerated
statement) were waiting for the outlaws at Dead
Tree Bend. They were well armed, and the colonel was determined
to rid the &ldquo;fire-lands&rdquo; of the Night-Hawks at one
blow.</p>
<p>Royal Funk believed the Indian and ran his boats ashore.
Then debarking, he wrote the message that so irritated the
Briton, and sent the canoes adrift.</p>
<p>The journey to the lake-shore had now to be performed
overland, and as the Wyandot was desirous of visiting Detroit,
he was made the head guide of the party. Before the
brave&rsquo;s appearance, Funk felt that his red-coated rival lay
somewhere in ambush; but now he believed that he had successfully
eluded him, and that they would not meet in the
forest again.</p>
<p>Spagano was impatient, and ill at ease as he helped prepare
the camp.</p>
<p>More than once he glanced furtively at Huldah Armstrong,
reclining on a robe at the foot of a sturdy oak, and often
paused in his labors as if to catch certain sounds for which
he seemed to be waiting. While gathering brushwood, for
the fire, he made several lengthy journeys into the forest, and
in the dim light, he practiced the old savage habit of listening
with the ear applied to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Once Roy Funk came suddenly upon Spagano in this attitude
of detecting sounds, and inquired into his action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indian listening for British footsteps; but none come to
his ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Funk was satisfied with the reply, and commended the
Wyandot&rsquo;s watchfulness.</p>
<p>It was ten or perhaps quite eleven o&rsquo;clock before the rude
camp was finished, and after midnight but three persons
therein appeared awake. The trio consisted of Spagano and
two Night-Hawks. The recumbent forms of the remaining
outlaws, including their leader, lay in the light of the dying
fire, and resembled wooden statues more than breathing clay.</p>
<p>The white guards sat at the foot of a large tree; Spagano
stood erect and wide-awake, a few feet to their right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whalley, I&rsquo;m as sleepy as a winter-treed b&rsquo;ar,&rdquo; said one of
the men, in his uncouth tongue. &ldquo;Say, haven&rsquo;t I nodded a
little within this past hour or such matter? I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s
come over me to-night. I know my chin has pounded my
knees while we&rsquo;ve been sittin&rsquo; here. But I can&rsquo;t help it,
Whalley; and if I do drop asleep, you&rsquo;ll let me go, and keep
mum to the captain, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but keep awake if you can, Zigler,&rdquo; returned Whalley,
and a yawn stretched his mouth to its greatest dimensions.
&ldquo;Mind ye, if we go to sleep, that Indian kin do as he pleases,
and we might wake up and find ourselves as dead as a herrin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead or no dead, Whalley, I&rsquo;ve got to sleep,&rdquo; drawled
Zigler. &ldquo;Wonder where that Injun got his whisky? Never
had any to affect my <i>eyes</i> afore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whalley here glanced at the Wyandot, who stood immobile
against the tree, looking into the darkness of the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought he had drugged the whisky, curse me if I
wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused suddenly, for Zigler was asleep!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zig, this won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; he said, with a smile, shaking his
companion&rsquo;s shoulder lightly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the frying-pan yet.
Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zigler responded with a swinish grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sleep then,&rdquo; said Whalley, supplementing his words
with an oath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch the Indian <i>my</i>self!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>He fastened his eyes upon the Wyandot; but soon the Indian
faded into a bluish mist, as it were, and the watcher was
asleep, like his comrade!</p>
<p>Spagano looked at the sleepers, and glanced from them to
the flask hanging at his waist. The glance was fraught with
triumph, and breathed of the red-man&rsquo;s proverbial treachery
to the white.</p>
<p>He watched the guards for several minutes and then approached.
The scrutiny pleased him, and he crawled from
the camp and disappeared in the forest. He moved down
the trail which the Night-Hawks had lately traversed, and
thirty yards from the camp paused and put his ear to the
ground.</p>
<p>All at once he started to his feet, and sprung toward the
camp.</p>
<p>Excitement burned in his swarthy face; but he was calm
withal, and when on the edge of the light of the dying fire,
he dropped to the ground, and after listening a moment with
head turned toward the wood, crawled forward to Huldah
Armstrong&rsquo;s cot.</p>
<p>Spagano was proving himself a traitor, and his bearing told
that this was not his first Judas act.</p>
<p>He reached the robe-couch, and bent over the sleeping
girl.</p>
<p>She lay near Roy Funk, who tossed uneasily about, the victim
of some terrible dream.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible for Spagano to steal the girl, if theft
was his intention, without rousing her, but he proved himself
equal to the emergency.</p>
<p>Suddenly stooping, he clapped one brawny hand over the
bright-red lips, while the other snatched their owner from the
ground, in the twinkling of an eye!</p>
<p>Then he sprung backward over the sleeping Night-Hawks;
but was brought to an abrupt stand by the sound of rushing
feet.</p>
<p>He leaned forward and looked with an expression of satisfaction,
which was soon transformed into one of horror.</p>
<p>For Colonel O&rsquo;Neill appeared, like a giant, in the flickering
light, and the savage caught a glimpse of a phalanx of red-coats
in his rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>What would be done?</p>
<p>It was evident that Spagano was aiding parties other than
O&rsquo;Neill and Royal Funk, and that he had mistaken a deadly
footstep for a friendly one.</p>
<p>He looked into the Briton&rsquo;s eyes a moment, and then
glanced at the sleeping outlaws.</p>
<p>The next instant he threw Huldah before his heart, and
sprung toward the forest, a wild yell pealing from his throat
as he executed the latter action.</p>
<p>The effect of spring and yell was electrical!</p>
<p>Royal Funk and all his comrades, save Whalley and Zigler,
leaped to their feet, to be greeted with a volley from the British
muskets.</p>
<p>It was a telling volley. Every Night-Hawk sunk back,
either killed or wounded, and Spagano, the girl-stealer, reeled
like a youthful drunkard.</p>
<p>Huldah Armstrong fell from his grasp, and the next moment
Colonel O&rsquo;Neill was at her side. As he stooped to lift
her up, the Wyandot darted to his feet and hurled him back
with the strength of a tiger.</p>
<p>Soldiers sprung to their leader&rsquo;s aid; but ere they reached
the spot Spagano and the girl were gone!</p>
<p>The red-coats caught a glimpse of the Indian&rsquo;s dusky figure
as he disappeared, and started to pursue. For several minutes
his footsteps guided them, and then those sounds ceased.
Colonel O&rsquo;Neill was resolved that Huldah Armstrong should
not escape him.</p>
<p>He had the fire fanned into a new existence, and soon a
dozen torches flashed their lurid flames throughout the forest.</p>
<p>The soldiers knew that it was poor policy to hunt a hidden
Indian with torches, but it was evident that Spagano was
desperately, ay, mortally, wounded, and had fallen somewhere
in the neighborhood. This conjecture, advanced by
the colonel, was soon confirmed.</p>
<p>The Wyandot was found dead at the bottom of a forest
knoll; but Huldah Armstrong was still missing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast the Indian!&rdquo; hissed O&rsquo;Neill, spurning the corpse
with his foot. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s past torture, curse &rsquo;im! But the girl&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
find her yet. We must find her! A hundred
guineas to the soldier who first discovers her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />ROWING AND RUNNING FOR LIFE.</h2>
<p>Spagano bore Huldah Armstrong to the knoll where his
strength suddenly deserted him, and he sunk to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White girl go,&rdquo; he said, looking at Huldah, who stood
over him undecided how to act. &ldquo;Indian got to die here.
English bullet cut life-string. The red-coat soldier want
girl; he come here soon. Look, there burns his soldiers&rsquo;
fires. Quick, girl! keep from him. Wolf-Cap in the wood;
he find you soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf-Cap,&rdquo; cried Huldah. &ldquo;Was you working for
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian nodded, unable to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A feeble red hand pointed to the south-east, and the Indian
fell back with a groan.</p>
<p>The settler&rsquo;s daughter bent over him, but the red-man&rsquo;s
soul was pursuing the trail to his happy hunting grounds, far,
far away from the death-freighted wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead&mdash;my only friend gone!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;What
shall I do? Give myself to the Briton? No, no! a thousand
deaths in these forests are preferable to a life with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The torches of the red-coated hunters flashed in her face,
and snatching up Spagano&rsquo;s rifle, she turned, and fled in the
direction lately indicated by the Indian&rsquo;s finger.</p>
<p>The moon had reached the meridian now, and the faint
light which she showered through the trees, enabled the flying
girl to pick her way without great difficulty. She was
confident that she was hurrying toward the Huron, and she
knew that by following the river-trail, she would eventually
reach Fort Strong. This hope nerved her to great endurance,
and at last, as the day was breaking, she saw the murky
water rushing lakeward.</p>
<p>A thrill of joy shot through her heart, and lifting her eyes
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
to heaven, she thanked God for guiding her to the water,
which was to her, at that hour, a synonym of safety.</p>
<p>She felt fatigued and threw herself upon the ground to
recruit her strength. She felt herself alone by the river, and
the birds performed their matutinal antics about her, perfectly
happy and unconcerned.</p>
<p>Lighter and lighter grew the forest, but Huldah Armstrong
saw it not. A desire to rest was to her but the precursor of
a doze, and she reclined on the river-bank with closed eyes
and half-shut hands.</p>
<p>Suddenly a boat rounded a bend a few yards above her
place of repose, and came rapidly toward her.</p>
<p>It was a small boat, and contained a man, who handled
the oars like one accustomed to their use. He was a white,
and wore the oft described garb of the settler; but a sword
lay at his side, and rifles and pistols. He glanced uneasily at
the banks, as he kept his canoe in the middle of the stream,
and seemed eager to reach a certain objective point still far
away.</p>
<p>But all at once his gaze fell upon Huldah Armstrong,
plainly seen from the river, and a moment after the discovery,
he ran his canoe cautiously to the bank.</p>
<p>At first, after striking the shore, he was inclined to believe
the maiden a decoy; but after a close scrutiny of the vicinity,
he became bolder and crept up the bank.</p>
<p>His large black eyes burned with a hateful triumph, not
unmixed with the baser passions, and his first care was to remove
the rifle from Huldah&rsquo;s feeble grasp.</p>
<p>Then, precisely as Spagano had done a few hours before,
he lifted her from the ground; but held her at arms&rsquo; length
that he might enjoy her horror and surprise at finding herself
captive again.</p>
<p>Huldah opened her eyes with a spasmodic start, and the
bright color of life deserted her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Strong, what does this mean? and how came
you here?&rdquo; she cried, staring into his face, covered with a
fiendish smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I boated it, girl,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t tell all
now. We&rsquo;ll continue my voyage, and when I get the craft
under way again, I&rsquo;ll tell a little story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;But whither are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very natural that you should put that question, seeing
that I&rsquo;m Captain Strong, and you Huldah Armstrong,&rdquo;
he said, with a light chuckle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Detroit, I guess,
and you&rsquo;re going along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Is it possible, Captain Strong, that you possess
the inhumanity of the savage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, if you would think so. But we&rsquo;re losing time
here. I want to overtake the barges; they&rsquo;re traveling
slowly, being heavily loaded, and I guess we can come up
with them at the mouth of the Huron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the last word he started toward the river with his
prize, and presently, with her hands fastened upon her back,
the settler&rsquo;s child faced the captain in the craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my girl, we&rsquo;re fairly under way,&rdquo; he said, when
they had proceeded some distance, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you the
promised story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to hear it, Captain Strong. I can not conceive
how you escaped from the fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men relent, sometimes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;After the abandonment
of the siege, they placed me on trial, and I found
that a current had set in in my favor. But many cried like
wolves for my death&mdash;among them, one Levi Armstrong.
But a vote was taken, and a meager majority pronounced in
favor of my exile. I swore never to return to the &ldquo;fire-lands,&rdquo;
and they marched me down to the river and shoved me off
with every thing I called my own. I was glad to get off, for,
girl, I expected to die. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you and your
father, I&rsquo;d have been with the king&rsquo;s soldiers now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I prevent you?&rdquo; asked Huldah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told your father that you heard me whispering to
Sawyer at the gate, and the old man resolved to nab me
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Captain Strong, you really are a traitor?&rdquo; said the
girl, bitterly.</p>
<p>He bit his lip and looked daggers at her before he spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes; but it is a hard name to bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poisoned the well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but Matt Hunter stood by me on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought the men would surrender before being
burned alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would. Oh, we had our plans perfected, Huldah
Armstrong. Your father arrested me in the nick of time.
Twenty minutes more of freedom and I would have flung
wide the gates to the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what reward was you to receive for your Arnold
trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life and yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was to have been the price of a massacre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m talking plainly now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The three
pistol-shots on the hill told me that O&rsquo;Neill accepted the propositions
which I sent him by the deserter Sawyer; but our
plans failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not reply; her eyes wandered from his expression
of triumph, and she thought of her perilous situation.</p>
<p>Captain Armstrong hated her, and to humor his hate he
would make her a hopeless captive. Mercy at his hands was
not to be thought of; he would shoot her down before he
would surrender her into other hands, and she upbraided herself
for not allowing O&rsquo;Neill to capture her in the forest. The
colonel, a monster though he was, possessed several good
traits; Zebulon Strong, the traitor, could boast of none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; to catch the British troops?&rdquo; she said, after
a long silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll go to Detroit, thence east. I shall enter the
army, probably; but build no hopes on my words; they&rsquo;re
poor foundations, girl. You shall never leave me until the
hand of death falls heavily on one or both of us. I swear it
by all that is good and bad! It is the oath of Zebulon Strong,
and he is a desperate man. There&mdash;girl, what do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange light had suddenly flashed in Huldah&rsquo;s eyes, and
quickly the traitor turned his head and looked up the river.</p>
<p>A boat containing three men was bearing down upon
him!</p>
<p>An oath shot from his throat as he turned again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the eternal world! I&rsquo;ve seen them in time!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and they might as well turn back, for they can&rsquo;t catch Zeb
Strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relinquishing the oars for a moment, he doffed his coat
and the next minute the canoe was flying down the stream
like an arrow.</p>
<p>The figures in the pursuing boat were seen to spring to the
oars with new life, and the race soon became one of the most
exciting character. Captain Strong possessed the strength of
a giant in his iron frame, and his oars lashed the waves into
foam, as he drove the boat toward his goal, lake Erie, distant
many miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t pray for their success,&rdquo; he cried, looking up
into Huldah&rsquo;s wishful, hopeful face, &ldquo;for they can&rsquo;t catch us!
It&rsquo;s impossible. Your father gave me a splendid boat with
oars that can not break. By heavens! with this canoe I
could shoot the fury rapids of perdition. With these
sticks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snap went an oar!</p>
<p>A cry of horror rung from the captain&rsquo;s throat, and he tried
to use the broken paddle, but without effect.</p>
<p>The boat began to become unmanageable, and he tried to
guide it ashore with the sound oar, swearing like a trooper
all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say that nothing but death could separate us?&rdquo;
he asked, darting Huldah a look of despair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Zebulon
Strong&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that. I&rsquo;m a traitor, too, and a devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canoe struck the bank at last, and the captain looked
at his followers, now within rifle-shot. He saw three weapons
leveled at his breast; but he was shielding it with the
girl, and they dared not shoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop the girl!&rdquo; came a voice from the boat.</p>
<p>Strong greeted it with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no fool!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Zebulon Strong, I am. So
good-by, boys! we&rsquo;ll meet again, mebbe,&rdquo; and he waved his
hat at the occupants of the boat, then sprung into the forest.</p>
<p>A minute after his disappearance, the trio reached the spot
and sprung upon his trail. They were Wolf-Cap, Mark Harmon
and an Indian well known to the reader, as Silver Hand.
Already the traitor and his prize had vanished among the trees,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
and his trail led toward the spot where Colonel O&rsquo;Neill had
lately surprised the Night-Hawks&rsquo; camp.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the captain knew but little of the intricacies
of the wood he was treading; perhaps he was bewildered,
for he was running <i>from</i> Detroit, having turned his back upon
the walls surmounted by the British flag.</p>
<p>The trio were confident of catching him, for the trail was
plain, and certain signs told them that he was giving out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never turn traitor again if we catch &rsquo;im,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap,
with determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Wolf-Cap,&rdquo; echoed young Harmon.</p>
<p>Three seconds later the crack of a distant rifle fell upon
the pursuers&rsquo; ears.</p>
<p>They did not pause; but exchanged meaning looks, and
quickened their gait.</p>
<p>The drama that followed the surprise of the Night-Hawks&rsquo;
camp was enacted over again.</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap and his followers at last came up with Zebulon
Strong.</p>
<p>But the captain lay full length on the ground, with a bullet
in his brain!</p>
<p>Sooner than he had expected, death had separated him
and his captive.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />THE LAST NIGHT-HAWK.</h2>
<p>Tired and disheartened in his search for our heroine, Colonel
Argent O&rsquo;Neill rejoined his soldiers in the Night-Hawk&rsquo;s
camp an hour or so before day.</p>
<p>He found Royal Funk but slightly wounded, and, with
Whalley and Zigler, the two guards drugged by Spagano,
closely watched by the troops. Funk looked daggers at the
officers as he approached and a smile of satisfaction stole
over his bronzed face when he noted that Huldah had escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you spoke truly when you prophesied that we would
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
meet again,&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel, halting before the outlaw
with drawn sword. &ldquo;Fire and furies! I&rsquo;m rejoiced that we
have met, and fortune has given me the best hand, as you
see. It&rsquo;s a hand of trumps, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, colonel, where&rsquo;s the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were quietly but tauntingly spoken, and the
smile grew broader on the Night-Hawk&rsquo;s face while his lips
moved.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Neill did not reply, but allowed his face to become livid
with smothered anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, colonel, where is the girl?&rdquo; he asked, again. &ldquo;If
you hold such a superb hand, why didn&rsquo;t you capture my
queen with one of your trumps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because your knave&mdash;that infernal Indian&mdash;baffled me,&rdquo;
said O&rsquo;Neill, apparently a little calmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, he&rsquo;ll keep the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we found him dead in the woods; but the girl was
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flash of hope lighted up the renegade&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should find her, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! I have no good trailer with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could track her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; retorted the colonel. &ldquo;Roy Funk, I&rsquo;m
not going to set you free and trust to your guidance. Colonel
Argent O&rsquo;Neill is not a condemned fool! But you&rsquo;ll be free
directly&mdash;free forever,&rdquo; and the old malignant look came
back to the red-coat&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to leave
this place. Curse the winding paths of this American
wood! No such forests in England; that is God&rsquo;s
land; this the devil&rsquo;s. Our guide got bewildered, else we
would have been here long ago, and we would have had the
girl, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will never be yours now, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! how do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not explain. Suffice it to say, Colonel O&rsquo;Neill,
that she will never in this world become your property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she ever become yours?&rdquo; asked the soldier, with a
devilish leer, as he leaned forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; was the outlaw&rsquo;s calm reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! do you plot in the very jaws of death?&rdquo; cried
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
O&rsquo;Neill, springing back. &ldquo;Fire and furies! I&rsquo;ll settle <i>that</i>
question before the break of day. Boys, are your muskets
loaded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall sergeant answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to exterminate the Night-Hawks of the fire-lands,&rdquo;
continued the angry colonel, turning to Funk again.
&ldquo;As you are their leader, you should be the last survivor.
Kings often witness the destruction of their kingdoms.
Ready to die, I suppose, Roy Funk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; was the firm response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do did I stand in your shoes and you
in mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d shoot you down like a dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m more merciful. I&rsquo;m going to grant you a soldier&rsquo;s
death, for you have fought for the flag of our king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then six soldiers were selected as executioners, and Whalley
and Zigler were placed side by side, fifteen paces from
the muzzles of the leveled muskets. Royal Funk was taken
aside and closely guarded on a spot from whence he could
witness the death of the last of his band.</p>
<p>He spoke to the doomed men and bade them die game,
which they promised to do.</p>
<p>Whalley and Zigler were brave men. They had faced
death in the covert, before stern vigilance committees, and
the field of battle, and they were not the persons to become
frightened at the monster&rsquo;s hideous visage now.</p>
<p>Colonel O&rsquo;Neill conducted the execution. He gave the
command of death in a stern tone, characteristic of the disciplined
soldier that he was, and the leaden volley stretched
the Night-Hawks dead upon the leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, was it not?&rdquo; he said, turning to Funk who
had witnessed the murder without an outward sign of emotion.
&ldquo;My men shoot well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; was the reply, and as the outlaw&rsquo;s glance
fell upon the still forms on the ground, for the first time, a
tear of affection stole to his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Braver men than they never lived,&rdquo; he murmured; and
then, in a lower tone: &ldquo;I am the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was now led forward, and halted between the corpses
of his two last followers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;I accord you a liberty,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Neill, admiring, despite
his hate, the unflinching courage of the man with whom he
was dealing. &ldquo;Raynor, untie his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier addressed drew a knife and obeyed the command.</p>
<p>Funk&rsquo;s hands crept around to his side, and seemed to hang
listlessly there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Royal Funk, would you see the deadly flash?&rdquo; asked
O&rsquo;Neill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a soldier, I would die as one!&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>The colonel drew a large handkerchief, and tossed it to a
soldier saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blindfold him, then. As a soldier, shall the outlaw die,&rdquo;
he said, sarcastically.</p>
<p>Two soldiers, one bearing a musket, now stepped forward
to blindfold the Night-Hawk&rsquo;s black eyes. One stepped behind
him and was in the act of drawing the kerchief into
position, when Funk&rsquo;s hands left his side. They shot upward
like rockets, and the soldier who stood before him with
bayoneted gun was hurled backward, like the covering of an
exploding rocket. His musket was wrenched from his hand
at the same moment, and the blindfolder was brained with
the stock before anybody could realize the terrible state of
affairs.</p>
<p>Roy Funk was free, with a musket in his hand!</p>
<p>Like a tiger he leaped upon Colonel O&rsquo;Neill, who retreated
a step, and threw up his sword to ward off the glistening
bayonet.</p>
<p>But as well he might have tried to stop the descent of an
avalanche with a straw.</p>
<p>The bayonet came down upon his breast with giant force,
and the next instant he staggered back with the shining steel
buried among his vitals!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, take that, colonel,&rdquo; cried Royal Funk, as he sent
the bayonet home, and then he hurled to the earth the only
soldier who had presence of mind enough to attempt to impede
his further progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Roy Funk is free again! Another band of
Night-Hawks shall gather at his call, and woe to the Briton
who crosses his path then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>He turned on his heel with the last word, and darted
away.</p>
<p>The soldiers regained their equilibrium as he disappeared,
and a volley that hurtled harmlessly among the branches was
sent after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free! free to hate the English, as I hate the Americans,&rdquo;
he murmured, as he bounded through the forest. &ldquo;They
have killed my Night-Hawks, and by heaven! from this hour
I never spare an English life. Now for the lake shore,
where I gathered the brave fellows who sleep beneath British
guns. There I&rsquo;ll find others as brave, perhaps, as they, and
we&rsquo;ll hunt O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s detachment down like the Indian hunts
the slayers of his wigwam pets. O&rsquo;Neill&mdash;I&rsquo;ve settled <i>him</i>!
Forever I&rsquo;ve canceled accounts with that liveried dog. But
the girl Huldah Armstrong? Shall I give her up, now that
I am free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused suddenly and seemed inclined to retrace his steps.</p>
<p>He was running in a north-easterly direction, his objective
point the lake, and he knew&mdash;he had gleaned from O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s
words&mdash;that Spangano had fled with the settler&rsquo;s daughter
in an opposite direction.</p>
<p>The outlaw was tempted to go back, and hunt for the prize
that had been his.</p>
<p>He had run a great distance, and daylight was chasing
night from the forest of the Huron.</p>
<p>It was extremely hazardous for him to go back now. The
British troops were between him and the missing girl, and no
doubt they would trail him to the death for the murder of
their colonel. Perhaps, while he stood undecided how to
act, they were on his track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can return with my new men,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, &ldquo;and
then I can snatch Huldah from my enemies. It&rsquo;s getting too
light for me to go back. I&rsquo;ll not risk my life for a girl,
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started forward again as he spoke the last word, but
his rapid gait had dwindled into the well-known dog-trot of
the Indian, and his whiter associate, the renegade.</p>
<p>His eagle eye took in every thing as he pushed forward,
and all at once it flashed with a new light, and he halted and
sprung behind a tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Some dark figure was approaching in the gray dawn; it
was coming directly toward him. That it was a man he at
once conceived, and the swaying of the body proclaimed him
a white. If Indians were pursuing the man, the outlaw was
safe; he could meet them boldly; but if white was chasing
white, he had best remain concealed. He kept his eye on the
runner until he almost started from the tree with excitement,
and an oath escaped his lips.</p>
<p>The fugitive was Captain Strong, and he bore Huldah
Armstrong in his arms!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of heaven, how did he get the girl?&mdash;and
how did he escape the vengeance of the settlers?&rdquo; exclaimed
the Night-Hawk, looking at the sight that greeted his eyes.
&ldquo;But fate is aiding me, and I&rsquo;ll make something of this golden
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several moments after the discovery of his identity,
Zebulon Strong, flying from Wolf-Cap and his friends, as the
reader already knows, continued to run directly toward Funk,
but suddenly he veered toward the right.</p>
<p>Had he caught a glimpse of his new foe? The outlaw
was inclined to believe thus, and cocked his musket with an
oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve shot deer with muskets,&rdquo; he said, audibly, &ldquo;and as a
running shot, I&rsquo;ve been celebrated. Can I hit a man&rsquo;s head
at forty yards? Well, if I can&rsquo;t, then my name isn&rsquo;t Royal
Funk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking thus to himself, the outlaw raised the weapon, and
glanced over the glittering barrel at his rival, who ran on, unconscious
of the new foe.</p>
<p>For a moment Funk sighted the moving figure, and then a
jet of flame leaped from the bore of the gun.</p>
<p>Captain Strong stopped suddenly in his tracks, and, with
the cry of &ldquo;A dead shot!&rdquo; the murderer bounded from the
tree and ran toward him.</p>
<p>But the traitor suddenly attempted to continue his flight.
He ran forward a few steps, then reeled, and fell dead!</p>
<p>Huldah, released, started back and gazed bewildered upon
the corpse. Her unexpected delivery had stunned her senses,
for she did not move nor take her eyes from the dead until a
hand encircled her arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Then she started violently, and recognized her new captor
with a shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine again, and forever, girl!&rdquo; cried the outlaw, as he
jerked her from the ground, and then he asked, quickly,
&ldquo;Who chased you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see presently,&rdquo; she cried, casting a quick, wishful
look toward the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Indians, as I know,&rdquo; said Funk, reading the language
of her eyes. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll outwit &rsquo;em, Huldah, whoever they
be. Roy Funk is alone in the world now. His boys are all
dead, and he wants somebody to cheer his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke the last words while he was running, with our
heroine in his arms, in a northerly direction, and at no insignificant
pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know these woods, we&rsquo;re not far from a place of
safety. Whoever hunts you shall never take you back to the
old stamping-ground. Huldah Armstrong, you will not believe
me, perhaps, when I say I love you. I do, earnestly,
truly, and with a pure love. You could make a man of
Royal Funk, if you would. Your obstinacy, coupled with
your pretty face, has caused me to act as I have. If the stars
love their Creator and the dove his burnished sweetheart, I
love you. Your lovers are out of the way, now&mdash;all save
Royal Funk, I mean. Will you not wean him from his wild
life by loving him? Will you not be the making of a
<i>man</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down into the girl&rsquo;s eyes, as he spoke, with genuine
earnestness, and for a moment his footsteps were the only
noise-makers in the great forest.</p>
<p>Then she answered him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Royal Funk, do not seek my love. It can never be
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must do that which I would not. You shall be
my wife. Death alone shall separate us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huldah started. Captain Strong had uttered the same
words!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />WOLF&rsquo;S DEN.</h2>
<p>The reader will recollect that Wolf-Cap dismissed his Indian
allies, Silver Hand and Golden Cheek, beneath the palisades
of Fort Strong, a few moments prior to his appearance
among the ranks of the besieged.</p>
<p>The red twain sought the camp of the foe, and in time witnessed
the triumph of Royal Funk, as already related. Silver
Hand, the shrewder of the two, saw that Colonel O&rsquo;Neill
would not relinquish the contest for Huldah Armstrong&rsquo;s person
without another struggle, and so he watched that red-coated
worthy narrowly. He therefore sent his confederate
down the river to intercept the Night-Hawk, and to warn him
of the ambush.</p>
<p>Golden Cheek undertook the mission cheerfully, while Silver
Hand hastened to secure the assistance of Wolf-Cap, in
order to snatch Huldah from her outlawed lover&rsquo;s power, and
to put an end to the marauding band.</p>
<p>Spagano, the Indian, who turned Roy Funk from the ambush,
and afterward stole Huldah from his camp and was shot
by O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s men, as the reader has already seen, was none
other than Golden Cheek. He had mistaken the British footsteps
for those of his friends, and he had thought to steal the
girl on their approach, that they might pour a destructive volley
among the sleepers.</p>
<p>But he failed, and fell in the wood, like many of his ancestors
had fallen before him.</p>
<p>Silver Hand was more successful. He found Wolf-Cap and
Mark Harmon after trailing them some distance, and hastened
down the river. They were surprised when they beheld Zebulon
Strong bearing Huldah Armstrong down the self-same
stream, and the pursuit which they inaugurated in bright anticipations,
ended over the captain&rsquo;s corpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This beats me,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap, who dropped on his knees
beside the dead frontiersman. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see through it all.
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
Here lies the man we&rsquo;ve been chasing, an&rsquo; thar&rsquo;s a British bullet
in his brain. Now the question is: who shot &rsquo;im? It
war no Indian, for the red-skins don&rsquo;t take to muskets; they
shoot rifles, and I&rsquo;m sure that Funk isn&rsquo;t in these parts. He
shoots a rifle with the smallest bore you ever saw. What
have you discovered, chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian addressed was approaching, with the glow of
discovery on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White man shoot traitor and run off with girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A white man, you say, chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, pale-face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me the signs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver-Hand strode forward, and pointed to a faint trail,
leading in a north-easterly direction. Wolf-Cap examined the
&ldquo;sign&rdquo; a minute, and then looked up into his companion&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got the girl ag&rsquo;in,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;who?&rdquo; cried Harmon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy Funk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not be alone in these parts and running toward
the Huron&rsquo;s mouth. Golden Cheek was to have guided
him to Beaver River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know his foot-track?&rdquo; queried the trapper.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I seen it too often to be deceived? I ruther guess
I have. Come, boys, while Huldah is in Royal Funk&rsquo;s power
it is a sin to rest. I&rsquo;ve an idea where he intends stopping a
while; but I hope he will go further on&mdash;I do, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Night-Hawk&rsquo;s trail told the trio that he was hurrying
through the woods at no insignificant speed, but they did not
follow in a gait equal to his own.</p>
<p>Before leaving Zebulon Strong, Wolf-Cap had covered him
with brush, and all alone the traitor slept the everlasting sleep
of the dead. Huldah Armstrong seemed a fatal prize. She
had brought death to the door of more than one heart. Spagano&mdash;brave
Golden Cheek&mdash;Zebulon Strong, Colonel O&rsquo;Neill
and the Night-Hawks had already fallen for her, and perhaps
others yet might die for the beautiful prize.</p>
<p>The trio pursued the trail an hour in silence, and Mark
Harmon was the first to speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf-Cap,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone, glancing at Silver
Hand, who was walking along, with his head on his breast,
his dark eyes on the faint trail, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about
some words that puzzle me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Card Belt slowly lifted his eyes to the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;War it some words that I left drop?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Silver Hand shoot &rsquo;em out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; they fell from Armstrong&rsquo;s lips last night, in the
fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did old Levi say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was standing at the third port-hole looking toward the
hill, and all at once I heard a voice at my elbow. It said:
&lsquo;If she was mine I could not love her more. God pity me
and let me live to make amends.&rsquo; I turned quickly, for there
was a depth of agony in the speaker&rsquo;s tone, and I beheld Levi
Armstrong moving from the port-hole at my left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap&rsquo;s face was ghastly in its coloring, when the youth
looked into it again, and a white hand griped his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it was old Levi?&rdquo; stammered the trapper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, for I spoke to him a second later,&rdquo; answered the
young man confidently. &ldquo;I heard the words plainly, and you
know all that he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap suddenly stopped in his tracks, and drew the
whole attention of his companions upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to see light now, and I curse myself for being so
blind until this moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf-Cap speak after while,&rdquo; said Silver Hand. &ldquo;We
on trail now and this no time for long talks. Pale Night-Hawk
fly to the big water with snow-bird, and he must be
caught before he sees the green waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven is helping me,&rdquo; said Belt, impressively. &ldquo;I feel
that the end of this terrible wood drama is near at hand. I
will tell my story here, and now! Silver Hand, you may
lean against that tree, or trail the Night-Hawk. I care not
which you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impatient Indian bit his lip, and leaned against the
designated tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty years ago,&rdquo; said Belt, looking at Harmon, &ldquo;I
lived beside the Mystic, in Connecticut. Not alone did I inhabit
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
the little cabin, where now the stranger dwells. A
wife kissed me then, and a babe was soon to cheer our
childless home with its sunny smiles. How I waited for the
new joy; but alas!&rdquo; and a cloud leaped to the trapper&rsquo;s brow,
&ldquo;alas! the devil came to our home. One night I returned
from Saybrook and found an empty cabin on the Mystic.
My wife&mdash;my Bessie&mdash;was gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belt paused, and, with face buried in his broad hands, he
swayed to and fro like a storm-cursed tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark Harmon,&rdquo; he cried, suddenly removing his hands,
&ldquo;God alone knows how I loved her. She never knew herself,
for humanity could not fathom my devotion and love. I
sunk to my floor on the fearful discovery, and in the morning,
a neighbor found me, but little less than a madman. Then
my eyes were opened. I found several letters in the old house
addressed to Bessie. They were signed &ldquo;Ralph&rdquo; and &ldquo;Morton.&rdquo;
I put the two words together and had a name&mdash;&ldquo;Ralph
Morton.&rdquo; For the owner of that name I hunted for eighteen
years, almost; but I found no traces of him nor my wife.
When I ceased to hunt, I had given her up for dead. I love
Huldah, because she looks like Bessie did twenty years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I do see light. I feel that Levi Armstrong is
Ralph Morton. God keep me alive till I can tell him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do with him?&rdquo; ventured the young
borderman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do, young man, with the devil who
should snatch heavenly happiness from your heart?&rdquo; said the
trapper slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would hunt him down and kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I am going to do,&rdquo; returned Wolf-Cap
through closed lips. &ldquo;Some men might forgive such a wrong
as mine, but I&mdash;never! Now for her, Mark Harmon, chief,&rdquo;
and the trapper started forward. &ldquo;Oh Heaven! do not deceive
me at this day&mdash;oh do not raise my hopes to dash them
down into darkness, for Huldah must be my child, or I die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wyandot was eager to resume the trail, and led the
van with a quick step. For several miles it remained plain,
and then it was lost in the waters of a narrow creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap. &ldquo;He is breaking
for the very place where I don&rsquo;t want to find &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he not continue his flight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because his captive is tired. In Wolf&rsquo;s Den he will rest
until she recruits her strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Wolf&rsquo;s Den?&rdquo; echoed Harmon. &ldquo;I have heard of this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should reckon you had, boy. Everybody in these parts
has heard of it, and I&rsquo;ve been thar. Why, thar are a thousand
caves in one, and dark halls lead&mdash;perhaps to the iron
gates of hell. Men have entered the &ldquo;den&rdquo; never to return.
Strange winds blow torches out, and there are bats in the
darkness as big as a coon. I have believed the Night-Hawks
used it for their head-quarters, before they descended upon
the &lsquo;fire-lands&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is acquainted with its terrors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. But we&rsquo;ll follow him to the greatest of them
all&mdash;death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trio waded down the creek whose banks were masses
of solid rock, which ofttimes towered to a hight of a hundred
feet above the water. The gray stone was covered with
a loathsome species of the dark green creeper, and the repulsive
head of many a glittering lizard protruded from the
fissures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Satan&rsquo;s land,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap, looking up at the
spectacle just described, &ldquo;and presently we&rsquo;ll enter his cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few steps brought them to a great fissure, that extended
from the top of the cliff to the water&rsquo;s edge, and into which
a man could edge his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are,&rdquo; remarked the trapper, stooping to examine
the foot of the crack. &ldquo;It looks like the cave of
death, but,&rdquo; looking up suddenly, &ldquo;it is inhabited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Harmon, springing to his side, &ldquo;has he entered
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the ground tells me so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the end of the Night-Hawk&rsquo;s trail had been
reached; but the final scene was wrapped in fearful obscurity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here afore, and I&rsquo;ll lead the way,&rdquo; continued
Wolf-Cap, stepping forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Silver-Hand go &rsquo;head,&rdquo; cried the Wyandot, suddenly,
and his right hand pushed the trapper aside. &ldquo;Wyandot
know more &rsquo;bout cave than pale-faces think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The next instant the Indian sprung into the fissure, and
darkness, damp and impenetrable, swooped down upon the
adventurers.</p>
<p>It at once became evident to the whites that their guide
knew much about the interior structure of the cave, for he
pushed forward in the darkness, seemingly with a well-known
destination in view.</p>
<p>But suddenly something struck the wall above the trios&rsquo;
heads, and then fell heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>Silver Hand stooped and ran his hand over the stony floor
until it grasped a warm object, with gigantic wings unspread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A winged rat,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, touching his companions&rsquo;
hands with his prize. &ldquo;It fell from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused suddenly, for other huge bats were striking the
walls and falling at their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens! does it rain bats here?&rdquo; exclaimed Wolf-Cap,
as Silver Hand griped his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody in the lodges of the winged rats,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He knock &rsquo;em down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must come from the bat-chamber. I&rsquo;ve heard of
it,&rdquo; said the trapper, quickly. &ldquo;He is fighting &rsquo;em there;
but how can we reach it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the Wyandot, with eagerness. &ldquo;Silver
Hand fight the flying rats there once himself. He find the
place soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they started forward, just as another quartette of
dead bats fell from the mysterious gloom above.</p>
<p>Somebody was fighting the winged mammals above the
three, for, as they advanced, they could hear his sturdy blows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br />RETRIBUTION.</h2>
<p>Let us return to the Night-Hawk and his prisoner.</p>
<p>To the former some of the events of Wolf Den was not
unknown. Wolf-Cap had spoken truly when he told his
companions that the cave had once served as the rendezvous
of the outlaws, and as such a place, their leader should be
acquainted with its intricacies.</p>
<p>He saw that his captive needed rest, and Wolf Den naturally
suggested itself. Therefore, he made it his objective point
after shooting Captain Strong, and intended to hide among
its dark chambers until Huldah had fully recruited her
strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go up to the bat-chamber, girl,&rdquo; he said, after entering
the mouth of the den. &ldquo;It is rather a gloomy place;
but the only one where we can catch a breath of fresh air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he lifted her from the ground and clambered up the
great broken rocks that obstructed the natural stairway.</p>
<p>Up, up, still up he bore the girl, and at last paused with a
long-fetched sigh of relief and satisfaction. He had reached
the top of the stair.</p>
<p>Funk here lowered the girl, and constructed a torch from
a sleeve of his hunting-frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cave used to swarm with bats,&rdquo; he said, leading
Huldah toward a dark portal of elephantine proportions.
&ldquo;But we drove them out, and used it for head-quarters.
Yes, this is the place, here are the stones on which we sat,
and the giant night-hawk, which Sam Cole drew on the wall,
still remains. Now, girl&mdash; What? a bat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His exclamation was caused by the flapping of unseen
wings, and then a black object shot through the torchlight, accompanied
by a demoniacal chattering.</p>
<p>It was a bat, and a great one, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they would never return after the smoking we
gave them,&rdquo; he continued, as a dozen of the hideous beings
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
darted from the wall to which they had been clinging.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll fight and drive them out now, for we must take
this chamber. Here, and here only, do we breathe fresh air.
It comes from the forest above us; the atmosphere in
other chambers is noxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust the torch into Huldah&rsquo;s hands, and doffed his
coat. Then, catching it at the neck, he braced himself, and
struck boldly at the hideous, chattering, screeching bats.</p>
<p>The walls of the chamber, which were black upon the
couple&rsquo;s entrance, were now gray, for they had been literally
covered with the somber mammals, which now flew about in
every direction.</p>
<p>More than one great horned owl added to the terror of
the combat, and the monster wings brushed the cheeks of
our heroine, who held the torch above her head that the
Night-Hawk might see what he was doing.</p>
<p>The heavy coat did good service. It knocked the bats to
the right and left, and dashed many to the feet of other
characters of our story, as the reader has seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re whipping the demons, Huldah!&rdquo; exclaimed Roy
Funk, triumphantly, glancing at the girl. &ldquo;Already they are
retreating to other fastnesses. Aha! they know Roy Funk!
they&rsquo;ve met him before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood like a giant in the center of the cave, whirling
the curious weapon about his head, and dashing his enemies
to the stones. His arm never grew weary, nor did his blows
weaken. But all at once he started back, and, dropping the
coat, picked up the musket, that lay at his feet.</p>
<p>His face was turned toward the entrance to the cave, upon
which the firelight fell, and his eyes were riveted upon three
figures standing there.</p>
<p>They were Wolf-Cap, Mark Harmon, and Silver Hand.
The outlaw saw this in an instant.</p>
<p>To recover the musket was the work of a second, and
quickly whirling upon Huldah, he snatched the torch from
her hand, and threw it above his head for the purpose of
sending it after the bats he had hurled to the dark corridors
below. In darkness he might hope to escape his new enemies,
who, alas for his plans, had been, for once, too quick for
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The Indian darted forward like a rocket as the flaring stick
shot aloft, and his hand closed on the outlaw&rsquo;s arm. But
Funk wrenched his arm from the gripe, and struck his
foe across the face with the fiery weapon. He renewed his
blow, under which the Wyandot staggered, but recovered in
a second and hurled him back. With the desperation befitting
his situation, Roy Funk struggled manfully, but Silver
Hand held him down, while Wolf-Cap secured his limbs with
ropes or cords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, you&rsquo;ve caught me at last,&rdquo; he said, looking
up into the faces of his white hunters. &ldquo;But if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for these infernal bats, Roy Funk would have triumphed
at last. I did my best to outwit you, and if I was free I
would do it again. Now, what are you going to do with the
outlaw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap and the young borderman held a conversation in
low tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to take you back to Fort Strong,&rdquo; said
Belt, at length looking at the outlaw. &ldquo;The settlers shall
judge you according to your deeds. I had intended killing
you with my own hands, Roy Funk, but you have wronged
others more than you have wronged me. Where are your
men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few words the outlaw narrated the attack on his
camp by Colonel O&rsquo;Neill, and the destruction of the Night-Hawks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the last of &rsquo;em?&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go to Fort Strong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care not whither you take me. But if I have to depart,
Card Belt, I would reveal a secret before we quit this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, drive ahead then, for we must get out o&rsquo; this hole
in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a time when the great pursuit of my life was
the getting of gold,&rdquo; said the outlaw. &ldquo;I was successful and
my eagerness became catching, for my men contracted it. We
amassed wealth in Canada and stored it in this very cave. It
is nothing to me now. I will lead you to the spot, and show
you what now is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Wolf-Cap and Harmon exchanged glances, while Silver
Hand looked on in stern silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, show us your gold!&rdquo; said the trapper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder door leads to it,&rdquo; replied Funk, looking over his
right shoulder at a hole in the wall. &ldquo;Light the way, somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap started forward with the torch.</p>
<p>Silver Hand led the outlaw after the trapper, and Mark
Harmon walked beside Huldah.</p>
<p>The dark portal led to another cave smaller than the bat-chamber,
but as gloomy. A strange smile toyed with the
outlaw&rsquo;s lips, as he walked forward, and there was a lurking
triumph in his tone when he commanded the party to
halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Roy Funk, where&rsquo;s your gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beneath this bowlder,&rdquo; answered the Night-Hawk, striking
a huge rock with his foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can not be moved,&rdquo; said Harmon.</p>
<p>Royal Funk laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said it must be moved?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If you can
trust me, undo my hands a moment, and I will show you the
results of ten years&rsquo; toiling for gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap drew his knife, but Silver Hand shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outlaw lie,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian does not like me,&rdquo; said Funk. &ldquo;I, and I
alone, can reveal the hidden gold, and when I have shown
you it we may talk about a ransom if you will entertain such
a subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not, let me tell you this now. All the gold in
the world could not buy your freedom,&rdquo; was Harmon&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;But we will see your riches. Now, mind you, Roy Funk,
not a sign of treachery here. This pistol is ready to speak,
so play the man, if life is of any value to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I betray your trust, shoot me,&rdquo; the Night-Hawk said.</p>
<p>The next moment Wolf-Cap severed his bonds, and he
stooped by the stone and ran his hand beneath.</p>
<p>For a minute he fumbled there, glancing up at the quartette
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I touch the box now,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;and here
it is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>As he uttered the last word his hand shot from beneath the
stone, and threw a cloud of dust into the watchers&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<p>They started back; the outlaw sprung forward! He
caught Huldah Armstrong from the ground, and darted toward
a precipice, dimly revealed by the torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiend!&rdquo; rung from Mark Harmon&rsquo;s lips, as he leaped after
the outlaw, his eyes half-blinded by the cunning trick.</p>
<p>He saw the Night-Hawk on the edge of the cave-cliff, and
his hand shot forward to save the woman he loved.</p>
<p>His fingers closed on her arm, and with all his strength he
jerked her toward him. Half over the precipice, the outlaw
could not struggle, and the young frontiersman tore Huldah
from his grip and started back.</p>
<p>Then a despairing shriek welled from Roy Funk&rsquo;s pale
lips, and clutching wildly at air he fell headlong into the
darkness below!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look down on the old fort from yonder hill,&rdquo; said
Wolf-Cap, on the evening following the scenes just related.
&ldquo;Then, Huldah, you&rsquo;ll find a father; then&mdash;&rdquo; he turned suddenly
from the girl, and finished the sentence under his
breath&mdash;&ldquo;then, I&rsquo;ll take vengeance for the wrongs of the
past. Levi Armstrong&mdash;no, Ralph Morton rather, you shall
tell me what became of Bessie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few steps brought them to the summit of the hill designated
by the trapper; but alas! Fort Strong did not greet
their vision. A confused heap of embers proclaimed where
it had once stood!</p>
<p>The spectators stared blankly into each other&rsquo;s faces, unable
to speak.</p>
<p>Suddenly Wolf-Cap started forward without a word, and
the others followed.</p>
<p>Everywhere among the ruins the victims of savage atrocity
scalped and tomahawked, were to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all dead!&rdquo; said Harmon. &ldquo;May Heaven curse
the fiends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A groan!</p>
<p>Wolf-Cap started forward, and lifted a log from the chest
of a man.</p>
<p>It was Levi Armstrong. He opened his eyes and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father! father!&rdquo; cried Huldah, throwing herself upon
him. &ldquo;Tell me, father, how all this happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splitlog came back and took me unawares,&rdquo; was the reply,
in a feeble voice. &ldquo;But, Huldah, I&mdash;am not your
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belt, you know me,&rdquo; and the glassy eyes wandered to the
trapper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Ralph Morton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a sigh. &ldquo;My crime is too great to be forgiven.
&rsquo;Twas all my fault. Your Bessie fled because I
threatened. Forgive her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, long ago,&rdquo; said Wolf-Cap, with tearful eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is dead, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Huldah, this man is your father. He will tell you
all. Card Belt, you can not take vengeance now, for I am
dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But little remains to be told to complete our story now.
Wolf-Cap guided Mark Harmon to a minister in the beautiful
Muskingum valley, and saw his long-lost daughter take
the vows of a bride. For many years the trio dwelt in the
then town of Mansfield; but in the city of the same name,
their descendants dwell and are honored to-day.</p>
<p>After all, it was well that Matt Hunter stole Huldah from
Fort Strong, for in the massacre that followed she would
doubtless have perished. Silver Hand lived to a good old
age, a true friend to the Americans, and the grasses of but
four summers have waved over his grave.</p>
<p>As for Johnny Appleseed, who appeared in the opening of
our romance, we may say, that he, too, fell beneath death&rsquo;s
sickle, ripe for the harvest of the simply just.</p>
<p>Roy Funk sleeps in Wolf&rsquo;s Den, while the bones of his
followers have been covered by populous cities and flourishing
towns.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
